263,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"We did have to wait a good amount of time for our food...but, the waiter explained that when we placed our order it would take a lil while since what we ordered was made fresh...kinda makes the wait bearable...and I had the St. Mimosa with OJ instead of grapefruit  juice and it was SUPERFANTASICAL."
264,SERVICE#POSITIVE,Service was fantastic.
265,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"--HOW IS THE SERVICE--

281,SERVICE#POSITIVE,The service was prompt and courteous.
282,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"07\/06\/10

Sure, Mon Ami Gabi serves mostly tourists, but the service and their food was phenomenal."

284,SERVICE#POSITIVE,Always consistently delicious and good service.
285,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Our server was polite, funny, and pretty attentive."
286,SERVICE#POSITIVE,He helped us with our meal decisions (my husband had escargot and I had the baked goat cheese) and was overall super pleasant.

301,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"I'm not going to each and ever food because everything was truly great but its the little things about the place that all add up to excellence in the end, not to mention my waitress was very generous with my drinks always making sure I had a full glass and some to-go as well!"

337,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"I felt the food was kept fresh and replenished often, I enjoyed seeing the staff behind the food as I could ask questions, get recommendations etc...

348,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Granted, I'm always expecting treatment at Asian restaurants to be one notch above the brutality that American POW's experienced by the Japanese during the Bataan Death March...  but illustrative of Thailand's ""Land of Smiles"" moniker, the servers were gracious, friendly and efficient."
349,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"I can handle spicy food, but they warned us that 3 or 4 packed a lot of heat."

365,SERVICE#POSITIVE,The seating inside was right away so we had no choice but to sit inside to catch breakfast.
366,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Point of note, if the server warns you twice about how hot something is, take the advice."
367,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"you can also drive 15 minutes off the strip to a much lovelier location, had the Benedict at both and found them of an equally delicious nature, and the service and ambiance were excellent in both locations too."
368,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Wonderful wine list (lots of german whites, a perfect foil for spicy Thai cuisine), great service, pleasant atmosphere."
369,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Earl's might seem overwhelming when you approach them and see the long lines of people and realize it's open seating... but as you'll soon be able to notice, the lines go by really quick and people are constantly leaving so a table won't be hard to get!"
370,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"I thought this place was a lot of fun, I thought the decor was awesome and I really enjoyed the service, it was very comfortable and professional without being stuckup."
371,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"(Although he still smiles when he thinks of how bacon is INSIDE the waffles)

In the true spirit of Hash House, we washed down as much of our entrees as we could handle with a brown bagged 25 ounce can of the King of Beers and even walked out with those in hand after we paid our server, who did a really good job throughout our visit despite being really busy."
372,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Pros:
Great variety
Good desert section
Excellent service (+Very friendly staff!)"
373,SERVICE#POSITIVE,I highly recommend this restaurant not only for the food but also for the great service and great price!

377,SERVICE#POSITIVE,Great food and decent service.
378,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"The service was good, but that's about it"
379,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"On a side note, the eye candy is splendid lol 

The food:

Onion Soup Au Gratin- I really liked their onion soup, it is one of their most popular items and it should be ordered."
380,SERVICE#POSITIVE,Decent line that moved quickly.
381,SERVICE#POSITIVE,Service was very attentive with continuous refills and empty plates whisked away quickly.
382,SERVICE#POSITIVE,She even suggested that each couple could split a meal and there would be plenty of food to spare.

388,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Plentiful seating and friendly staff, the breakfast was excellent thaw many times I've been here, lunch steak frites not a fan."

390,SERVICE#POSITIVE,The Wicked Spoon staff has been very accommodating with our kids.
391,SERVICE#POSITIVE,Unbelievably fantastic food and excellent service.
392,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"You look around and everyone has the same sad face of ""Where is my food?????"""

398,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Other than that, the service is good, I'll take the second experience as a rare occurrence."
399,SERVICE#POSITIVE,Good space between tables and clean tables.
400,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"She was super sweet and patient, always clearing our dishes without fail and juggling our needy orders - 18% gratuity well deserved."
401,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"When you pay the bill, they give you a little iPod in the checkbook where they ask you to fill out some questions - a neat little feature that I had never seen before."
402,SERVICE#POSITIVE,I want to give 5 stars alone for the restaurant being so accomodating when I tried booking a large party lunch reservation for my birthday weekend.
403,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Food service seems to be clean and professional, service was attentive, warm and quick, overall it's pretty good."
404,SERVICE#POSITIVE,Jus hope the food taste great like last night and I get the same server
405,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Everything looked delicious, service was supeb."
406,SERVICE#POSITIVE,Our party of 10 was given a choice to sit near the food or a bit further away in our own little private seating area.
407,SERVICE#POSITIVE,I had one scoop each of 3 flavors because it was offered to me (what a nice guy).
408,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Despite the intimidating reviews describing long lines for this restaurant, luckily my party of two was seated fairly quickly."
409,SERVICE#POSITIVE,I love the new waiting system: at check in you are given a time estimation and told you will receive a text message when your table is ready.
410,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"what i will come back for:
1)  efficiency \/ wait:  i love the check in and leave phone number thing, so smart, because why waste customers' time standing in line when the casino can maximize their profit and let customers shop, gamble, and continue to spend money!"
411,SERVICE#POSITIVE,Saturday night waiting in line was moving at a good pace.
412,SERVICE#POSITIVE,The staff was super friendly and extremely attentive; not one damn detail overlooked.
413,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Not only was the food a (super awesome) party in your mouth, the service here was impeccable."

416,SERVICE#POSITIVE,Service was quick and my glass of orange juice remained topped off the entire time.
417,SERVICE#POSITIVE,I will note this is the first good valet experience even if it is on the third try.
418,SERVICE#POSITIVE,The cleanliness and flow of people is streamlined and it seems that management has thought of everything.

420,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"It beats every place in both cali and nevada 
The staff is friendly and efficient."

430,SERVICE#POSITIVE,Wishing you only good eats and service... Eat On ;D
431,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Overall:
I had such a lackluster and disappointing experience with friendly staff."
432,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"As for me I go back to Vegas in 18 days and I will probably eat at least 3 times there, the entire staff from the girls at the front, managers, servers, busser's, chefs are always incredible to me and any one I have brought there or told to dine there, even if you don't want a burger go for the desserts ;) till next time David Cagle"
433,SERVICE#POSITIVE,The service is excellent and the waiters are really attentive with refills and cleaning up used plates.

436,SERVICE#POSITIVE,Service is always good and it's a popular place so there might be a little wait.
437,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Hardly waited in line, great service."
438,SERVICE#POSITIVE,Excellent service.
439,SERVICE#POSITIVE,Gordon Ramsay knows how a restaurant should be run and this place is a prime example!

453,SERVICE#POSITIVE,Excellent food and above and beyond service.
454,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"I wish I got our waitresses name because she was so amazing, friendly and on top of things!"
455,SERVICE#POSITIVE,Our waitress was extremely informative about our food options and everyone that presented a dish made me feel as if i was on top chef or Hell's Kitchen.
456,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Wonderful experience because of Julie, the spiritual waitress."
457,SERVICE#POSITIVE,So I was happy to see that drinks were taken care of and waiters were always on top of their game.
458,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Service was fine, with drinks coming quickly, and dirty plates being cleared quickly."
459,SERVICE#POSITIVE,The service was quick and hardly any waiting.
460,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"I know that we don't go to  buffet and expect good service, but if we already paid 18% gratuity, I expected the service to be 18% worth."
461,SERVICE#POSITIVE,She was very nice and apologetic.
462,SERVICE#POSITIVE,the food is wonderful and TABLE service is great.

474,SERVICE#POSITIVE,I went midweek for dinner so there was no line whatsoever.
475,SERVICE#POSITIVE,Service was awesome!
476,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Staff was really nice and service was so quick, almost to quick."
477,SERVICE#POSITIVE,The service was great...food....ok nothing spectacular.
478,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"If you've ever eaten at a University lunch or dinner room, it's basically one of those tell-a-guy-to-make-awesome-things stations, albeit with better quality ingredients (I particularly appreciate the inclusion of feta and steak), but it's really nothing extraordinary."
479,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"First of all there was no wait which was already a good sign (or because it was 9am and most of the folks that went out the night before just went to bed an hour before that)...we get seated and about 3 minutes later, our server greets us."
480,SERVICE#POSITIVE,I would reccomend this place to Yelpers.This is the best review buffet in vegas.The sushi was great the service was great.Pizza tasted good and so did the fish.
481,SERVICE#POSITIVE,He was very good about refilling waters and beverages and encouraged everyone to eat heartily and order any beverages in addition to the ones we already had.
482,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"You should try their burger, the best in Vegas, they got more and more types of burgers  , and the service was really good especially the manager Zac."

484,SERVICE#POSITIVE,The line wasn't too bad late night after we left the club.

487,SERVICE#POSITIVE,The service was even better.
488,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"But, the service was exceptional--the only redeeming quality."
489,SERVICE#POSITIVE,The staff was also very friendly and helpful in our selections.
490,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Before I like to start my review...Thank you my fellow Chiver that got me and friend in without waiting in line...Keep Calm and Chive On

Service: From the host to the server, I was welcomed with open arms with gentle gestures and a big smile."
491,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"This experience is based on our mid afternoon ""brunch"" at a time when the restaurant had few patrons, as such we were seated promptly and our waitress prompt and very pleasant."
492,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"I've never been to a buffet with such an awesome waiter before, we gave him a good tip, he deserved it."
493,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"My server would occasionally stop to check on me, often engaging in some lovely conversation and never making me feel like I should hurry up and leave."

500,SERVICE#POSITIVE,The service was good but the prices are steep.
501,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"What we got: yum x 1000, great service, great food, great efficiency, clean bathrooms, bright ambience (inside at least), okay parking and a fantastic experience all around."
502,SERVICE#POSITIVE,service: server was attentive and nice eventhough she had another table with a whole bunch of rude drunks.
503,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Waiter service was great, as usual."
504,SERVICE#POSITIVE,Very nice selection and the staff was a great help constantly coming around asking if you want drinks and clearing your table.
505,SERVICE#POSITIVE,Lines can get long but staff is super efficient and the sandwiches are worth the wait.
506,SERVICE#POSITIVE,It was very busy the night we were there (and I'm assuming it's like that pretty much every night) but our food still came out very quickly.
507,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"There were a few parts of the buffet that I liked, like that they had crab legs for lunch and the brisket and the service."
508,SERVICE#POSITIVE,There were six of us and we got through a short line very quickly and had our food within 10-15 minutes of sitting down.
509,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"On top of the food, the service was really good."
510,SERVICE#POSITIVE,The server was friendly and knowledgable and willing to give recommendations on his favorite and the most popular dishes.
511,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Being one who considers service to be nearly as important as the food itself, we were effectively SPOILED by our server, Chris (#93 -- ask about the numbers)."

774,SERVICE#POSITIVE,We were seated quickly and the food came out fast enough.
775,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Better meat selection, better sushi (although I see it sub par), best in dessert hands down, better service, and of course better pricing."

794,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Pros: 
I like the service."
795,SERVICE#POSITIVE,Service: Awesome.
796,SERVICE#POSITIVE,The 5 Star rating speaks more the to wonderful time (including the food and service) and over-all experience rather than just the food.
797,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"It's great to have polite waiters\/hosts but if the person serving your plate is slapping it on the plate with death stares and no smile, then all the great service before has come undone."

828,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"The service was attentive, the décor was very beautiful... but the food itself was just ok at best."
829,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Great service, nice atmosphere, food is not at all my thing - big portions of mediocre carbs and grease."

840,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=VDLsrE-gNdkh8N82jlEo5A&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

SERVICE: From the hostess taking my picture http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=Eo1U2kj6OyU_a_Kr9pC-6A&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw and quickly seating me, to the bar (milk) tender who was way cool and friendly, the service was great, fast and polite."

847,SERVICE#POSITIVE,Great service though.
848,SERVICE#POSITIVE,Fantastic to see that kind of service at a place do busy.
849,SERVICE#POSITIVE,Each server took special care to place our orders so the BurGR logo on the plates was facing us.

852,SERVICE#POSITIVE,We loved the atmosphere and the waitstaff was great!
853,SERVICE#POSITIVE,great service too.
854,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Very good food, well schooled waiters, great view."
855,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"I like this place very much, great customer service, great view, and amazing food."
856,SERVICE#POSITIVE,So the 3 stars was for service and the fact that something didn't agree with us.
857,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"I read some reviews that people wait for 4 hour for a table, so we went to around 9pm last night, it only took 15 min-20min waiting time"
858,SERVICE#POSITIVE,Service was point on even as busy as they were.
859,SERVICE#POSITIVE,At buffets a good barometer of service is how they quickly whisk away your used plates keeping your table clear for more to come!
860,SERVICE#POSITIVE,They keep the food warm longer when you are piling copious amounts of food on your plate--consumption of which will at most buffets result in the last few items being cold.
861,SERVICE#POSITIVE,The table right next to us had a waiter who took the time to explain the menu and recommendations as well as helped them pick drinks from the iPad.
862,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Seating is plentiful, service is good."
863,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"The waiter (I forgot his name , I am sorry) was really friendly and made an effort to help us decide on certain items."
864,SERVICE#POSITIVE,Food and service was great!
865,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"The service was very friendly, and the food and mimosas came out quickly

I went for a very savory option in the seafood crepe, and I didn't know how tasty seafood could be in the morning!"
866,SERVICE#POSITIVE,Her recommendations on food were amazing!
867,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Our server was always around and attending to our needs whether it be clearing up the empty dishes, or refilling our drinks."
868,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Bad food:
Service: A-, the service was great."
869,SERVICE#POSITIVE,There are not many places that I've been to where all of the staff members are on the same level of great quality service.
870,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"It is difficult to find very good customer service in Las Vegas but when you walk into this burger restaurant you are treated like a ""fine diner"" despite the somewhat casual fare."
871,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"(Note that reservations are for indoor seating only, since outdoor seating is still first-come, first-served.)"
872,SERVICE#POSITIVE,We got a good waiter so that helped with our visit.
873,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Moderately priced for Vegas
Good service 
Not too long of a wait time on a Friday night"
874,SERVICE#POSITIVE,We came here around 12 noon for brunch  on Saturday and the wait is about 15 min.
875,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"The service was impeccable, the decor charming and decently authentic, and even though we were seated in 100 degree weather in an indoor\/outdoor space, we were plenty cool."
876,SERVICE#POSITIVE,All the servers I had for my many meals here were excellent.
877,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"The service is fast, and lots of places to eat, despite the long lines and crowded restaurant."
878,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"In the end, they comped my whole meal and tossed in some free mini muffins."
879,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Amazing Thai food, plenty of seating, and great service."
880,SERVICE#POSITIVE,Then as I walked away the two hostess told us goodbye and to have a good evening.
881,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"We got great service, and the hanger steak was grilled to perfection."
882,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Fabulous burgers, fabulous service and great atmosphere."
883,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"The time frame was right, but I got to spend the time relaxing and not in line."
884,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Staff was polite, friendly, and made great recommendations."
885,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"The service was great, our server helped us a lot in judging how much food we should order."
886,SERVICE#POSITIVE,I had even dropped my fork and by the time I even noticed it was on the floor the waitress was already setting a new one on my table!
887,SERVICE#POSITIVE,The service was top-notch.
888,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Real classy guy and had ""The Sense"" as I hope all servers do (""The Sense"" - knowing when and how often to check in on a table)."
889,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"The food was superb, the staff was really on point even to the point of cleaning up the crumbs that were on our table."
890,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Great service, great drinks and I had a When Harry Met Sally Moment with my meal choices."
891,SERVICE#POSITIVE,Bar staff was attentive and comical which was good for the experience.
892,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Service was great, food was outstanding and we're definitely going to go back again when we get to Vegas the next time."
893,SERVICE#POSITIVE,The wait staff was on top of all our needs and cleared away the emply plates very quickly.
894,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Now to top it all off, the service here is amazing!"
895,SERVICE#POSITIVE,What also keeps us coming back is the customer service of all the workers.
896,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Overall, good presentations and I suppose worth a try just for the experience, but I don't think I would come back."
897,SERVICE#POSITIVE,5 stars to the staff for putting up with the rambunctious crowd.
898,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"1 star for the nice staff
1 star for nice restaurant."
899,SERVICE#POSITIVE,Our server was very nice very funny i really wish i remebered his name of our server.
900,SERVICE#POSITIVE,Our drinks were always filled when we came back from our rounds of getting food.
901,SERVICE#POSITIVE,It feels like every one of these things was made for each individual customer.
902,SERVICE#POSITIVE,The view is nice and staff was really good.
903,SERVICE#POSITIVE,now that's what i call customer service : )  Coming back here again when its not so hectic to give the place another try.
904,SERVICE#POSITIVE,Pricey veryyyy pricey food should be warmer more hot seafood would be appreciative the waiters was extremely nice
905,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"The person who escorted us to our table was warm, welcoming, and hilarious to talk to!"
906,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Décor is great, service was excellent."
907,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Great food , great service."
908,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Positives:  the decor was very nice and the wait staff was very friendly and timely, no line and was seated immediately(Thursday night), the shrimp ceviche, prime rib, baked salmon, and several of the pasta dishes were very good."
909,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"But what I do remember and know is that our waitress was the bomb, the food was well worth the price of admission and I can't wait to get back to the Hash House."
910,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Amazing food, great service, and even better view!"
911,SERVICE#POSITIVE,The staff was super friendly and helpful with menu recommendations.
912,SERVICE#POSITIVE,I wish I could have eaten more and that I got to experience it without having buffet for lunch so I could have appreciated the food more instead of comparing.
913,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"The only bad thing I have to say about Wicked Spoon is that I did not take the time time to try it earlier - what was I thinking  - 
The food was was  excellent 
Service was amazing 
Never thought a buffet could match the service and food quality  of a upscale restaurant - Wicked Spoon has surpassed that expectation 
We will be back again and again"
914,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"A few minutes later, an appetizer comes to our table...compliments of the manager."
915,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"No one rushed me and I was able to just able to take my time and enjoy the evening, I wouldn't make this a regular place because of the price, but special occasions will see me back there."
916,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I felt the selection was lacking, service was slow, and the price just really didn't match up with the amount of sub-par food I was able to consume."
917,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Bit pricey - but tough luck you're at the Wynn.
918,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I was full, but not $51.99 full."
919,PRICE#NEGATIVE,People complain that it is too expensive... but the portion size is completely equivalent to what you pay.
920,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Looking at the menu, dishes were on the pricey side."
921,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Most defintely not worth $65 for our meal.
922,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"go to the Spice Market at Ph, save money and get great food."
923,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I feel Subway tastes better and is also cheaper.
924,PRICE#NEGATIVE,It was worth the nearly $100 for 2 (weekend price) price tag compared to the other Vegas buffets we looked at.
925,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"If it were a little less expensive, or if the food was extraordinary, it would've been a five star review, but I didn't try anything that would warrant a 60 dollar price tag."
926,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I wouldn't recommend paying 50$ for this buffet.
927,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"A bit pricey tab at $46, but not at all out of the ordinary in Vegas and at Caesar's."
928,PRICE#NEGATIVE,For 40$ per person there are MANY nice places you can eat in Las Vegas good quality food.
929,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"But I admit I pay the price because I actually like the cheesy pink atmosphere, I really like chocolate, & I like the special treatment given to diamond card members."
930,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I don't like wasting food, but I also refuse to fill up on things that aren't good after dropping $40 to eat there."
931,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Very over priced.
932,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Yup, but not fresh, all frozen and bland, etc,

As you make your final decision here's what it boils down to: for what you'll pay ($60\/ea) you'll stand in line to get a large choice of pretty good buffet food self-served in a massive, fairly loud room."
933,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I liked the Northern Thai dishes, and I enjoyed the meal, but what with the renaissance of Thai food in the Tenderloin, this was a pricey choice for a meal that usually is pretty terrific in San Francisco at a much lower cost."
934,PRICE#NEGATIVE,80 min wait + $76 for a holiday dinner.
935,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Definitely not worth the $80 for two people to eat dinner.
936,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I am still wondering how anyone could justify charging $16 dollars for this kind of salad.
937,PRICE#NEGATIVE,It's pricy but the food simply cannot be beat.
938,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The place is cute, the decor is nice and feels kinda swanky... sans the swanky price."
939,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"That being said, the food itself made the $55 worth it."
940,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"So this time around the price and selection increased, but I did not mind considering the fact that they now served prime rib, lamb, smoked salmon and much more!"
941,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"However, I am dissatisfied when I spend money yet remain hungry; therefore, I do not envision myself returning on an empty stomach any time soon."
942,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"At first the prices look expensive, but when your food comes it is well worth the cost."
943,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"This place is overhyped and overpriced for being the ""BEST buffet"" in vegas!"
944,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"If you're going to pay $50 for a meal, you might as well go to a five-star restaraunt and buy a steak."
945,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Easily one of the most over priced buffets in Vegas due to the quality of food and service.
946,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The panna cotta was also very delicious ^q^

Overall, although it was pricy, I had a good experience."
947,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"All in all, a good place, but for the price-to-taste ratio, I'd make the trip out to the M for the Studio B buffet over this any day."
948,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Crab legs were not very tasty but I had to have them anyway since it seemed to be the only way to justify the steep price tag for the meal.
949,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Lotus of Siam is simply good but nothing special, particularly since it is so expensive for Thai food."
950,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I was quite hesitant to begin with because of the prices, but being that it was GR I thought, sure, why not?"
951,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I paid $40 expecting the best buffet ever due to all these rave reviews from Yelp, however, once I was able to look at what they were serving, I was in disbelief!"
952,PRICE#NEGATIVE,So essentally I got screwed on this deal.
953,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"It is a large buffet so the star, but the food is not fresh, the price ridiculously expensive, the horrible service the waitress spoke all the time doing nothing with the ones at the next table and without filling the glasses."
954,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Maybe I was expecting a lot more but this place is overpriced and the food is just blah.
955,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I say it's better to go to one of the cheaper buffets in Vegas or Bacchanal because the food is way better there and at least you get more out of what you pay for.
956,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Food is decent but not worth the price.
957,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"For being $52.99 a person and surrounded with hype, I came in on a Friday night expecting a great buffet."
958,PRICE#NEGATIVE,OMG..  orgasm in my mouth for 40\/pp.
959,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Pricey but definitely pay a visit if you get a chance
960,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I think that even though food was good it is not worth the money.
961,PRICE#NEGATIVE,For breakfast nothing special save a few dollars and go to the regular cafe in Paris for breakfast same type of food but cheaper
962,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The only things that they severed  that I would even think of ordering at a restaurant were the mushroom & truffle soup and the red velvet whoopie pie

All things considered, I would much rather go to the Bellagio Buffet, save the $20\/person and get better food"
963,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Over-priced and food was terrible.
964,PRICE#NEGATIVE,This buffet is expensive but definitely worth it if you're going to eat the expensive items.
965,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"There drinks and service are real good too, but what do you expect if you pay around $50 for brunch."
966,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"All things considered, a decent meal, but nowhere near expectation for $60 a person."
967,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Food was just ok. Over price with this quality of dishes.
968,PRICE#NEGATIVE,you are spending 56$ for food that are worse than fastfood.
969,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Suffice it to say that this is a dessert that is a lot of money for a lot of nothing.
970,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I think I would have given this buffet 5 stars if they didn't raise the price for Memorial Day.
971,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Is a little pricy , but most places are in Vegas."
972,PRICE#NEGATIVE,It is like 86 for too people that is crazy.
973,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Not a great value.
974,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Have been going to this place for years, I'm sad that they have done away with the all you can eat lunch buffet because ordering off the menu can get a little pricey, but the food is always delicious!"
975,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"It is a bit pricey, but there are many comps available through casino and online game play that help to defray the cost."
976,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"On the expensive side for somebody who's used to $9.00 buffets, but well worth it."
977,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Paying like 80 dollas for dinner I expected wayyyyyy better quality food.
978,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Used to love this place but the prices have increased.
979,PRICE#NEGATIVE,The food was decent (better than average) but the price was absurd ($34) and the line was long.
980,PRICE#NEGATIVE,It's not worth the $40 (price w\/ tax) for dinner.
981,PRICE#NEGATIVE,The special price of $48 per person was well worth it.
982,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"What a disappointment, maybe we went in with high expectation, maybe we were just mad that we gave up our one night in Vegas to Wynn instead of Bacchanal.. nonetheless, the Buffet doesn't taste like it's worth the $40 price tag."
983,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"48 bucks got one beer, two regular fountain drinks, a little cup of soup and three tiny little hot pocket sized sandwiches."
984,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"A pricey burger, but a good one nonetheless."
985,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Insanely delicious buffet for the price!
986,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"the regular food is good, but way too over priced."
987,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The buffet was about 35 dollars BUTTTTTT if you want bottomless mimosas (IT'S A MUST), it'll only be an additional $9!"
988,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I just feel if you pay this much for a buffet, you should get great food."
989,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I thought Vegas buffets were good and cheap..boy was I wrong!!!
990,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Reasonable prices.
991,PRICE#NEGATIVE,For that price I would rather eat at Bacchanal.
992,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Can't ask for a better way to eat food instead if spending tons of money
993,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"If you're going to spend a good amount of money for a buffet, this is the place."
994,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Now, if you would rather be left alone to eat in peace and rather not spend the $cA-chiNg$ for a higher end all you can eat.... Well, then this is not the place for you my friend."
995,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Drunken noodles with seafood: 0\/5 again, portion was small for the price."
996,PRICE#NEGATIVE,We weren't sure why we paid for lunch when majority of the food was leftover breakfast items.
997,PRICE#NEGATIVE,seriously overpriced IMO but there was enough takers for the dinner meal to cause a 45 minute wait on a Wednesday.
998,PRICE#NEGATIVE,A waste of a LOT of money.
999,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The cork fees are exhorbinant also, but a better deal for better wine if u are inclined to bring and appreciate."
1000,PRICE#NEGATIVE,4) The price is more than most of the other Vegas buffets.
1001,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The most famous buffet in Las Vegas, the Bacchanal buffet at Caesars Palace is delicious and filling, but pretty darn expensive."
1002,PRICE#NEGATIVE,For $40 dollars I don't think this buffet is really worth it (probably because I am not a big fan of the snow crab legs).
1003,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Don't get me wrong I don't care about spending money on things that are worth it........but I felt what happened to us that day was a complete rip off.
1004,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Super pricey generally, but I expect that for the location."
1005,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The lamb chops and the sliders were really good, but I fail to see why this place carries so much hype with a high price tag."
1006,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Compared to other buffets it IS good don't get me wrong, but it not what it's hyped up to be and not worth the price."
1007,PRICE#NEGATIVE,This is currently our favorite Vegas buffet - it is pricy but you will get high-quality food and massive variety.
1008,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I found the food to taste right on par with other diner food that is cheaper elsewhere.
1009,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I think for $50 per person it didn't wow me as much as I think it should, there is a huge selection of food but nothing stood out."
1010,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I wont ever go back, I can get way better food for $44 and wayyy better service and not have to wait as long."
1011,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Nothing spectacular stood out and it is a bit pricey for what you get.
1012,PRICE#NEGATIVE,For $50 save your money and just go to a good sit down restaurant.
1013,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I had been researching different buffets on the strip on a Sunday and this one was about $5 more then others.
1014,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Their buffet pricing was at 43.99 for weekend.
1015,PRICE#NEGATIVE,This is definitely a place to experience...just dont think about the price & have a good time!
1016,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"For what it is, the EoS is a great stop for late night, or inexpensive anytime meals which are hard to find on the strip."
1017,PRICE#NEGATIVE,For $28 a big disappointment.
1018,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Very good Sunday champagne brunch, but somehow not quite as impressive as I expected for $28.95, or based on its reputation."
1019,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Buffets are a waste of $ for me, as I don't indulge in prime rib and crab legs like the majority of people."
1020,PRICE#NEGATIVE,43 per person was worth it for lunch but we got lucky because at 3 dinner started so we got there at 2:30 and got to enjoy both!!!
1021,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Written up as a premier buffets in LV, we found it disappointing for the price."
1022,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Keep in mind that we go to a buffet this pricey to try their seafood and main dishes, and we do not eat too much meat."
1023,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"And let's face it - if I'm not gorging myself on expensive seafood, this buffet is not worth the price."
1024,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Truffle Burger* $21 (couple of us ordered it) - not worth the price.
1025,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"But if they're gonna charge the same $51, they should have those items!!"
1026,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"That's $6 for a few, barely-there crystals of salt, for anyone paying attention!"
1027,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"If i wanted to dine like that, i woulda gone to the local food court where they have panda express and a burger joint and paid a lil less."
1028,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Well...the expensive stuff at least.
1029,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"They should remake the food selections ASAP

Pros:
* Locating in Cosmopolitan
* Their desert is the only thing good there
* They put many of their food in small cup\/pan\/pot

Cons:
* For the subpar food selection they offer right now, $40+\/person is a ripoff (Don't come here if you like seafood, their selection is very limited; they use crab legs the same level as those in $15-$20 asian buffet places)
* Most of their food doesn't taste like $40+ buffet, it was so plain and basic
* Their ambiance\/decor can be considered ""OK"" if it locates elsewhere not name Cosmopolitan, but for such an upscale trendy hotel like Cosmopolitan, Wicked Spoon should spend a little more money on the restaurant's ""vibe""
* Our waiter was discriminative."
1030,PRICE#NEGATIVE,The food was quite good but for the price I would expect better service.
1031,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"There was very little to complain about except for the price, but I don't review based on price."
1032,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"It was simply too bad that brunch was lacking in nearly all aspects of what was offered for dinner in terms of selection and quality -- no oysters, no ceviche, no sashimi, dry meats, no mochi ice cream, no macarons -- but having to pay almost as much only because of free flowing champagne."
1033,PRICE#NEGATIVE,They had the nerve to still Charge me full price.
1034,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I had the Hanger Steak, which comes topped with a merlot butter and a mountain of Mon Ami's signature fries - ""frites"" - which were simply amazing to begin with, but when used to mop up the steak's juice and left-over butter... beautiful!"
1035,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"We were the transition time between lunch and dinner and unfortunately had to pay the DINNER price...and since it was the weekend before Christmas, we paid the HOLIDAY pricing which was about $62 with taxes."
1036,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Only two stars because this place is waaaay over priced if you're coming to eat dinner plus dessert.
1037,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I must say it's a damn good place for romantic dinners..the ambiance is quite classy and beautiful..the waiters were very friendly......the french onion soup and the scallops entree were good...........the only minimal complaint i have is it's a bit pricey...........we finished off with a White Chocolate Bread pudding dessert which topped all the items of our dinner....I sure recommend this place for romantic dinners at least :)
1038,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I've experienced at other places better with less on the price.
1039,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Large buffet selection however I really can't say it's worth the $50 (includes mandatory tip).
1040,PRICE#NEGATIVE,For the price you pay the service should be up to par.
1041,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I know some people compare the price with a fine dinning restaurant and think it's a good price but I compare it with other Vegas buffet and think it's not worth the wait and the money.
1042,PRICE#NEGATIVE,When we arrived it was actually 40 dollars no explanation why?!
1043,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Or maybe month since it's a little pricey...
1044,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Bacchanal is probably the best buffet on the strip for the money - but it is still quite expensive and doesn't stand far ahead of the others anymore.
1045,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"By the way, they will add an 18% mandatory gratuity to your bill if u have 8 or more guests and the waitress doesn't even serve soft drinks."
1046,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The restaurant was Ok, nothing really to write home about especially when you figure in the pricing of it."
1047,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Crazy expensive buffet, very little was decent-tasting."
1048,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Take a walk around the hotel but skip the buffet and go to the one at ballagio for 10 bucks cheaper and food that won't make you sick.
1049,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"It's $14-21 just for a burger you order your sides like fries separate @$10 each  , so really it's a $25 burger ."
1050,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Not the best value in the world, but that's the case for most buffets..."
1051,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The bf bought the Original (Roasted beef, sharp cheddar and creamy horseradish sauce) and the Montagu (roasted beef & turkey, swiss & cheddar cheeses and mustard sauce)  I'd have to say the Montagu was the BEST!"
1052,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I think 2 stars is about right here is why:

Average dish is around $11-$15."
1053,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Throughout the meal, the food was at most mediocre and most likely able to be bought at any restaurant in our home town, making us instantly regret our decision to spend more than $200 on the place."
1054,PRICE#NEGATIVE,If I'm paying 50 dollars for two burgers and fries and a couple of cokes I want good service or at least average service.
1055,PRICE#NEGATIVE,only bad side is the liquor isnt included in the buffet lol.
1056,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Otherwise, I wouldn't eat here for a meal, the food was pricey and from looking at everybody's food it didn't look like anything spectacular."
1057,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The Buffet at the Wynn (delicious, wide variety, awesome atmosphere but price point is high and the wait can be ridiculous)

4."
1058,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"If you are going to spend your money on a buffet, there are much better ones at other hotels for similar costs."
1059,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Red Lobster probably serves better seafood than this place, and at half the cost."
1060,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"They are fresh, and high quality, but other buffets for $10 or $20 cheaper will have the similar seafood as well."
1061,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The price is expensive for a burger, but I don't mind trying new expensive restaurants every once in a while."
1062,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"While the service is adequate, the quality of the food items does not justify this price."
1063,PRICE#NEGATIVE,It's actually 49.99 per person.
1064,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"All in all I'm glad I went for the experience, but it is quite pricey."
1065,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"If you're going to plunk down $40, might as well go to a decent restaurant off the strip and get something other than buffet fare."
1066,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Everything was ok, a couple of the things were pretty good, but for $40 in Vegas I want something amazing."
1067,PRICE#NEGATIVE,This place is slightly spendy ($40 for the both of us) but the food was amazing.
1068,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Bottom line - not worth the money or the hype...unless you love Asian food.
1069,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"They have a $2.50 split plate charge*, but unless you eat like a linebacker, are a 300 foot tall lizard, or plan to take it home, you will be wasting a lot of food."
1070,PRICE#NEGATIVE,There are two reasons that I rank this as #2 is the value (not a very good value at all) and the side dishes were not up to a level of excellence that the other entrees were.
1071,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Prices are cheap, service is cool and the place is opened 24\/7...
How could you complain?"
1072,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"We purchased the buffet of buffet pass on friday for $65 a person and for bacchanal it's an additional $25 charge for dinner to use with the buffet pass, it is seriously expensive, regularly $51.00 a person for dinner."
1073,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Over priced omlets\/salads, took the food about 45 min."
1074,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"We paid $34\/person, kinda pricey... at least compared to all the other buffet in town, but it's definitely worth the money."
1075,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I mean for 80 bucks I could have had better food at any old buffet.
1076,PRICE#NEGATIVE,On the pricy side but worth going if your in Vegas.
1077,PRICE#NEGATIVE,All the food doesn't seem like it's worth $50.
1078,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I wish I would have asked to look at the food before paying 95.00 for me and my husband to eat here.
1079,PRICE#NEGATIVE,However I am rating it 4 stars because of the price.
1080,PRICE#NEGATIVE,The average price for dinner is like $55 so you better get your monies worth.
1081,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Wicked Spoon is also wicked expensive so major thanks to the sugar daddy BF for the multiple trips to this yummy buffet :)

Even though we dined for both lunch and dinner, we were lucky enough to show up during non-busy times."
1082,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"However, the selection is too limited and price too expensive to give it 5 stars."
1083,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Bottom line is: I'd only recommend if you want a stellar view of the fountains and don't mind paying quite a bit for okay food.
1084,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"It's now $35, which is a bit steep if I'm not guaranteed amazing food."
1085,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I've been wanting to try this buffet for awhile now, but the price always kind of kept my party away."
1086,PRICE#NEGATIVE,$50 paid for some very expensive drunk munchies!
1087,PRICE#NEGATIVE,The price is $27.99 and trust me you don't want to spend it here！ nothing is up to the standard.
1088,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"However, you're paying for the atmosphere and in that case I say it was worth it."
1089,PRICE#NEGATIVE,It has a lot of hype but if you go it won't be the best meal but worth it if you don't pay the over priced Easter version.
1090,PRICE#NEGATIVE,This buffet is terrible and expensive.
1091,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I know i'm not the first or last person to rate this place but I still wanted to give some insight :) ohh the cold hot chocolate cost $24.00 with tax serves two people.
1092,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"So after coming here several times for both lunch and dinner, I would recommend lunch if you don't want to break your wallet since the difference between both meals is minimal."
1093,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"for the price, i'd rather go to a nice restaurant and have a really good meal."
1094,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Yes, it's expensive but when you walk out, just don't slide in that $20.00 you were going to in the slot machine."
1095,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"so in my opinion if your not going to only going to eat Prime Rib and crab legs, the most expensive items on the menu, then you could save yourselfs money and eat at a cheaper buffet."
1096,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"For this price...I might rather go to the Wynn, Bellagio or Wicked Spoon buffet instead."
1097,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The burger was somewhat small for its price but the price is reasonable because of the famous me ""Gordon Ramsay""."
1098,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Evrn though it's a tad more expensive than other buffets, I personally think it is worth every penny!"
1099,PRICE#NEGATIVE,This place is a little pricy and it's pretty busy as well.
1100,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I was very disappointed with the whole thing especially for the place and the price.
1101,PRICE#NEGATIVE,The tab went from $65 to $85 quickly.
1102,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"All in all, I wouldn't pay $75 for that experience again."
1103,PRICE#NEGATIVE,It's overpriced and the food is not that great.
1104,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"However, this place would be much better if the price goes down from 50$ to 40$ becuz no lobster, salmon Sashimi and perhaps better pizzas."
1105,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"For $36.95pp, you're better off going to one of the restaurants instead."
1106,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Vegas buffets are simply supposed to be grander more expensive versions of your local Golden Corral.
1107,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The crab legs are SNOW crab legs, for this price they should be KING crab legs and get the pealed shrimp out f those tiny little shot glasses."
1108,PRICE#NEGATIVE,For $54 you can get a much better meal in Vegas and not have to stand in a line for an hour.
1109,PRICE#NEGATIVE,The food isn't cheap but the experience is worth the price.
1110,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Not worth the money or the wait in line.
1111,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The burgers were pricey, but that was to be expected before I even sat down."
1112,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The brunch buffet is $30\/pp, versus regular breakfast buffet $20\/pp."
1113,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"It is definitely one of the more expensive buffets, but the options are much better than your typical buffet."
1114,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Waited for this buffet to reopen and best word to describe it ""Dissapointing"" Overpriced and the food was terrible."
1115,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Portions are normal and not huge for what you would expect (considering that it's Thai food and for their prices) However, the food is good and they have a decent wine selection."
1116,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Honestly, I'm not sure what the hype is with this place and I definitely cannot say it was worth the price."
1117,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"My recommendation would be to get here at the end of lunch, so you pay much less for the same type of food."
1118,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I did think they did great when it came to a variety of small plate dishes, but dang not worth the price."
1119,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Some breakfast items were still out, which was a bummer since we paid for lunch - who wants scrambled eggs at these prices?!"
1120,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I don't mind paying that price if the food was good, or the selection was vast."
1121,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"For that much money, the Wynn Buffet is much more worth it."
1122,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"the prices for the meals are pretty high, but then again it is quality food you will be receiving as compared to other all you can eat restaurants with lower standards to food preparation."
1123,PRICE#NEGATIVE,The buffet was not cheap but between the amazing food and my endless bloody mary's it was worth every penny.
1124,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Asian menu- 5\/5
Mexican street taco- 5\/5
Steamed crabs- 5\/5
Dessert- 5\/5

Italian, Meat Carving sections, and seafood are like 3\/5

but overall, so worth the 50$ 
My favorite buffet on the strip so far!"
1125,PRICE#NEGATIVE,It was expensive around the holidays ($50\/person) but had every meat dish you could imagine.
1126,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The part that sucks even more is that for about the same price, you can get a pretty good meal even in Vegas at a ""high end"" joint."
1127,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I think the quality of the food has gone down since my last visit here and the price has gone up at least 25%.
1128,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"If you're not willing to trade the content and salty factor, being quick and cheap is totally not worth it."
1129,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"It is the best buffet that I have ever had, however it is too pricey and the wait was long."
1130,PRICE#NEGATIVE,The only reason I give this place a 4 is because of the expensive prices & long wait :(
1131,PRICE#NEGATIVE,People complaining about paying $12 to $15 dollars for a burger need to remember you are eating at a restaurant located in a large hotel\/casino on the strip in Las Vegas with the name of one of the most well known chefs in the world right now.
1132,PRICE#NEGATIVE,It's well worth the wait and it will cost a few bucks more than a traditional burger but go for the experience.
1133,PRICE#NEGATIVE,It is not worth $40 buffet at all.
1134,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The $29 brunch seemed a bit pricey to me, but I was willing to pay for it given the quality of the food."
1135,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The food seemed to be of high quality, but in order to get your money's worth you need to come on an empty stomach"
1136,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"For the price you pay at dinner ($51 with tax and tip), you can get a much better meal elsewhere."
1137,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"(crab was difficult to eat and hurt my mouth ..:\/) 

$52 per person for dinner which includes soft drinks!"
1138,PRICE#NEGATIVE,This is a good place to eat at if you don't have a car to get off of the strip to find cheaper food.
1139,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"If you've got $42 to blow on dinner, you can get a really nice meal at many of the good sit-down restaurants on the strip."
1140,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"NOT worth the price ($45)

After waiting for an hour and a half, we were very excited to try the food but ended up so disappointed :( 

1st trip around, everything tasted like it was left out for too long or over cooked."
1141,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I would rather go to the Rio World Buffet, pay less money and eat a larger variety of mediocre food."
1142,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Overall the dinner was good but pricy.
1143,PRICE#NEGATIVE,The food was horrible - certainly not worth the price tag or the hullabaloo.
1144,PRICE#NEGATIVE,The price for buffet was pricy and they didn't have and a big variety to chose from.
1145,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I think this place need to upgrade their menu or at least reduce the price if they dont want to lose more customers.
1146,PRICE#NEGATIVE,It was a good first time experience and if you have the cash you should try it.
1147,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The food however, quite disappointing for the price, I ordered the all hail Caesar salad for $14 and what I received was a pile of romaine lettuce and a single crouton."
1148,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Basically, the food looks great but tastes underwhelming and disappointing for its price - any other $50 buffet would be better (i.e."
1149,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I would give it 5 stars but the price for food here is RIDIC!
1150,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I always go to vegas on the holidays and unfortuantely, that means jacked up buffet prices.."
1151,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Good food, but overpriced  The wait is long during peak hours, but that is to be expected for most buffets in Vegas."
1152,PRICE#NEGATIVE,The two meals with two glasses of $11 champagne (not counting my complimentary one) plus tip came to $112.
1153,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"This is such a blatant rip off that I am inclined to shake my head at Gordon and give him one of my own ""such a shame"" mutterings, but yes, it was indeed a very good burger."
1154,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"You do pay more since it is a higher end buffet, but I think its worth it because of  the variety  of the selection and quality of food."
1155,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"For about 50 bucks a person compared to al the other buffets in the area....it's better but honestly it's not worth it (but what on the strip is really ""worth it""."
1156,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"For the price, I expected better service and better food."
1157,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Which I find a little bit excessive for the quantity and variety of the times.
1158,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"A close second to Wynn Buffet IMO, but for the price, I might come here more often."
1159,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Loved the cheesecakes and mochi ice cream (green tea especially)

Bottom line, check was like $200 almost with a bottle of wine (not the best I've tasted but I didn't order it)."
1160,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Overpriced mediocre food.
1161,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The cashier also mentioned that due to the size of our party, there would be an automatic 18% gratuity to our bill."
1162,PRICE#NEGATIVE,but that cost $6 which is half the cost of my dish so it better have been good!
1163,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The price is expensive at $65 for 2 people for sub par food taste, quality, selection, ambiance, and decor."
1164,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Word of advise for the people who are planning to try the buffet, make sure the price is around 22$ (then its ok to pay for the quality of food you get) , its no where close to the 37$ value."
1165,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Children are charged the same as adults $37 - serious?
1166,PRICE#NEGATIVE,We ordered over $100 worth of food and over all 2 were ok dishes - drunken noodle prawns and sticky rice and mango for dessert... For all the hype and what not really not worth it.
1167,PRICE#NEGATIVE,It's not cheap but I find the quality of the food to be consistently good.
1168,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Many other buffets are either cheaper or offer more choices, but the price you pay for the taste and quality of food at The Buffet at Bellagio, you can't get any better than that."
1169,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Although it was exactly the price I had thought it would be, the experience was great!"
1170,PRICE#NEGATIVE,The issue is with their prices for some average bar food that you can get anywhere around town for much less.
1171,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"If I am going to pay buku bucks for a buffet, id expect everything to be up to par."
1172,PRICE#NEGATIVE,And it's cheap....especially compared to what you'll pay eating on the strip!
1173,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"It really is quite a simple creation that has a different name people aren't familiar with (outside of the Yelp praise), and thus they mistakenly value it higher than any other chain which could easily supplant it."
1174,PRICE#NEGATIVE,The cost of this buffet is not the cheapest and there is always a wait so be prepared for that.
1175,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Can't go wrong with this dish IMHO
- Druken noodles fried duck- small portions for $27 Greasy don't know why so much hype over this dish."
1176,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"When you paid $40 for a buffet, you go for the most expensive stuff!!"
1177,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Little pricey but what isn't in Vegas?!
1178,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Plus, it doesn't feel like such a good value at $10\/sandwich."
1179,PRICE#NEGATIVE,For the price .. i felt like it wasn't worth it.
1180,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Nothing special considering the price and the name that's attached to this place.
1181,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Kind of pricey but good place to eat non the less.
1182,PRICE#NEGATIVE,At 50 bucks I'd rather spend a bit more and to a nice restaurant in vegas.
1183,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Gelato- It was cool that there was gelato at a buffet, but I've had better gelato."
1184,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"So, in short, I definitely recommend this place as long as you don't mind the wait or price."
1185,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"All in all, Hash House was good but a bit over-hyped, over-priced, and probably not worth the wait next time we visit."
1186,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Burgers are way overpriced for what you get.
1187,PRICE#NEGATIVE,This is how they keep their prices friendly... they keep the portions small and you have to order sides separately.
1188,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I was a little disappointed that they raised prices, but given the high quality of the food offerred at this buffet, it's okay."
1189,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"They have a separate ""express"" line for VIPs or people who want to pay extra $25 per person to get in faster."
1190,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Super expensive, $70 per person."
1191,PRICE#NEGATIVE,It just so happened the most popular dishes were the most expensive dishes.
1192,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Overall very good quality and worth the premium pricing.
1193,PRICE#NEGATIVE,It's not cheap by any means but the quality of the food you get is excellent.
1194,PRICE#NEGATIVE,And I see steamed is not an option huh - for the price we pay?!?
1195,PRICE#NEGATIVE,NYE 2010 Dinner  (Wasted over $400 here on NYE 2010 prix fixe menu. )
1196,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"A big reason this is as expensive as it is is definitely the seafood section, they have Alaskan king crab, snow carb, etc."
1197,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Sure it's huge portions and you get your dollars worth cuz this place ain't cheap!
1198,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The holiday dinner was priced at $52, which is VERY expensive."
1199,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Because there's not a worse feeling than paying good money for bad food.
1200,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Bacchanal is probably the pricest buffet on the strip, but for a reason, it has been voted the best buffet in Vegas, and there are a lot of buffets in Vegas."
1201,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Price aside this buffet was colossal in size.
1202,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"For that amount of money, I was expecting something that eluded excellence from the very first sip."
1203,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I would have no complaints about the increased holiday prices if this included more items on the menu or even the same number of items.
1204,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Pretty good food, great ice cream but way too expensive, The New York location is so much better."
1205,PRICE#NEGATIVE,i know it's hip to be international and all -- but serving jook at a pricey buffet such as this is just a joke.
1206,PRICE#NEGATIVE,This buffet is not worth 50 per person.
1207,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The staff wasn't really friendly either, and at $65 dollars a person I really expected a better experience."
1208,PRICE#NEGATIVE,This place is worth the price I paid.
1209,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Bacchanal Buffet might be pricey but it is definitely worth every penny and it doesn't feel like a buffet but a real trendy restaurant vibe.
1210,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Oh, and at the beginning of the meal 5 of us shared the scallop appetizer, which was good, but not good for the $16 it cost us."
1211,PRICE#NEGATIVE,not good for the price!
1212,PRICE#NEGATIVE,The price tag may seem a little heavy but we planned our day around this meal and really felt we got our money's worth.
1213,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"But because nothing really impressed me, I don't know if I'd come back to put down more money for lunch and dinner entrees."
1214,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"For the price of $42, I was expecting most of it to be higher quality."
1215,PRICE#NEGATIVE,went back recently it was very disappointed for the money.
1216,PRICE#NEGATIVE,The prices are very overpriced.
1217,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Of course it is pricey but no worse that any others in buffett, but way way better"
1218,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Or you could go to M Resort's buffet, not wait in the long line and not spend $70pp!"
1219,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Skip the Wynn Buffet and get more bang for your buck and better quality food.
1220,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I still think it's a fun restaurant to stop into, but don't waste your money on dinner, focus on booze and sugar."
1221,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I couldn't believe it I just paid $47 for a buffet that wasn't that special.
1222,PRICE#NEGATIVE,If you want to waste 30 bucks a person put the money on a number at the roulette table instead.
1223,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Like other fancy hotel buffets in Vegas, the price here is high, though it fluctuates depending on whether you come for lunch or dinner and whether you come on a weekday or weekend (higher prices for dinner, higher prices for weekends)."
1224,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Cost-wise, this buffet is pricey."
1225,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I wished I ate crab legs or shrimp cocktail to make this buffet worth the money.
1226,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Unfortunately, the price here, even considering that it's Vegas, compared to the overall quality of the food, is what brings this review down to three stars."
1227,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"For the value of your money, it's not worth it."
1228,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Not cheap, but well worth the quality food, good service and magnificent view"
1229,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Had it not been for the saving grace of those onion rings, this meal would have been a disaster, especially given the price of the burger."
1230,PRICE#NEGATIVE,The service was good but the prices are steep.
1231,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Now at the express window they charge $11 for the smaller size!!
1232,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Price: Relatively expensive, not worth it in my opinion."
1233,PRICE#NEGATIVE,The price was over done.
1234,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Way better than the standard ones on the strip and well worth the extra few $$ it may cost you.
1235,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Some fantastically original offerings...some standard Ponderosa\/OCB offerings...mainly mouthwatering, and more less worth the $53 check and 45 minute wait."
1236,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"It's around $65 for weekend dinner buffet (that price included tax and 18% gratuity for my 8+ party), but they have such a vast variety of the food and wonderful presentation for each of the dishes that the price doesn't stop me from wanting to go back even as I'm writing this review."
1237,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"We like buffets and while this one was more expensive than our local, hometown variety, we expected that in Vegas."
1238,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Price\/value is 2*.
1239,PRICE#NEGATIVE,The food choices are limited for the price of $38 per person.
1240,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I felt like I probably got my monies worth, not necessarily in the quality of the food, but rather in tons of drinks (way more than $19 worth) and great desserts."
1241,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The selections, the quality of the food, the service, it was fantastic and the price of about $22 is in line with any other breakfast buffet in town."
1242,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Over-rated in a town where you can get better buffet food at a much lower cost.
1243,PRICE#NEGATIVE,People save your $15 bucks and put it towards gambling or something else.
1244,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The food was exceptional, but honestly, for the price, I don't think it was a good value."
1245,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The Brussels Sprouts were great as well, but I may have I counted but 11 halves, which sadly calculates to nearly a buck a sprout."
1246,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Many other options on the strip for a delicious burger at a reasonable price.
1247,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Also as far as buffets go, the Wynn was pricey."
1248,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"They have wide variety of dishes, all priced at $49.99."
1249,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Would never recommend this buffet for anyone especially at this price.
1250,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The portions here are pretty good, but the quality of the food is mediocre and definitely not up to par with their prices."
1251,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Expensive compared to others, but possilbly the best buffet Vegas."
1252,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"It's not the cheapest buffet in the world but let's face it, you're in Vegas and this buffet isn't a Golden Corral food trough."
1253,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Thou shall not balk, heave, hyperventilate, faint or barf at the buffet price of $40 per person for thee are in for the time of thine life in gastronomical delights

14.Thou shall walk into the buffet with eyes wide open gawking like thee were ""FOA*"" seeing the immense variety of food

13."
1254,PRICE#NEGATIVE,i feel bad for people who paid $50+ for that night's dinner.
1255,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"So two stars for the hype and price, which did not meet expectations by a long shot."
1256,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The buffet was less than average, prime rib tasted like Chuck steak, crab tasted like it had been brined for years, NO cocktail shrimp or oysters for a $45 buffet."
1257,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I would say the ambiance and service is good but the food for the prices they charge is just ok. 
Actually one of the best eggs Benedict I've had in Vegas was at New York New York in the Italian restaurant adjacent to the Lobby."
1258,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"If you are on a budget do yourself a huge favor and go out to eat somewhere more cheaper where they are more attentive and caring about their customers and you will more than likely still have a lot of that money leftover from the $140+ I have spent here .....and ended up hungry anyway....go see a show, go shopping, do anything else ......trust me you will be happier with your choice that throwing it away at this place
- Too much hype 
- Not worth it one bit
- Just regular food
- Bad or non existent customer service"
1259,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"And the garlic prawns were nice, but as someone else noted the portion was small in comparison to the price."
1260,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Bacchanal is the best, but it comes with a pretty hefty price tag and a usually long wait in line."
1261,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Not cheap at all but compared to The Buffet we hit the night before, this was a much better experience, one that we were not disappointed in spending all that $ on."
1262,PRICE#NEGATIVE,But those two things in no way justify the price or the wait or the raves this place gets.
1263,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Food was pricey but that was expected going in.
1264,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"there's nothing really inherently special about the menu, and everything is super duper pricey- i remember seeing salads and burgers for $12-$15."
1265,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I enjoyed the Rio a lot more and it's at a lower rate.
1266,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The price is a bit steep, yes...but the same goes for the rest of Vegas so I don't really have any complaints."
1267,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The price is expensive, but you get what you paid for, which is an awesome array of food at a way above average buffet."
1268,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"If I am paying 50.00 for breakfast, I want a freaking poached egg white."
1269,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"When you first see the prices on the menu, as with anything on the Vegas strip, then seem high."
1270,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Chinese broccoli beef chow fun - Delicious
Chow Mein - very good quality
Roast Duck - very good

Carving Station:
Prime rib was good
Beef Rib was good
Smoked chicken wings were good
Smoked Pork Belly was ok 
Kobe Sliders - yum

Seafood:
Shrimp and Gritz was good
Shrimp Cocktail was good
Muscles were ok

Skip the sushi - meh

Fried chicken - just ok

Overall really good buffet and worth the high price."
1271,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Lousy service after paying top dollar leaves a bad taste in the mouth no matter how amazing the food is.
1272,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Overall, an overpriced place that is super hyped up."
1273,PRICE#NEGATIVE,No child prices.
1274,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"For $42 per person, I expected more, and it unfortunately did not deliver."
1275,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"We went to the Wynn buffet a couple days ago and it was not only cheaper, it was better tasting and nicer looking."
1276,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Dinner is only $1 more, at $27."
1277,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"If you are looking for $200 beef jerky and to be treated like crap upon check in you should make a ""reservation"" for this place."
1278,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"(Drooling) The price is pretty reasonable for its deliciousness & in the city, however the portions are smaller than the usual Thai restaurants I go to."
1279,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"price is riddiculous for the food they serve, there is no reason for that place to be that expensive."
1280,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The food was all good, but nothing special and I've paid less for better on the Strip."
1281,PRICE#NEGATIVE,This was the most that I've ever paid for a buffet and it was well worth it.
1282,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"For the price, this place is just average."
1283,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Dinner is the most expensive but has the best food, take advantage of the seafood, although their might be a line by the seafood station it is definetely worth it if you paid for the dinner."
1284,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The day we went, Friday\/Saturday dinner was at $50.99 (show your players card for a $1 discount per person)

Probably one of the better looking buffets on the strip."
1285,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"My girlfriend paid for brunch since I paid for dinner the night before, but from the moment my jaw dropped upon seeing the price - $90 and change for two people - things just kept getting worse."
1286,PRICE#NEGATIVE,This place is expensive though for dinner.. about $50 a person when I went.
1287,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"However cuz I wasn't as hungry, I just decided to ordered a side ($6 - are you freaking kidding me?!?!"
1288,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"It is, of course, overpriced and hardly worth the wait, but if you want quality and choices like this in Vegas you have to either pay for it or have the patience of a very bored saint to stand in line."
1289,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Sure, they use some fancy toppings and cheese, but at the end of the day it is still just an over priced burger and fries."
1290,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Mine was one of the more expensive burgers ($16), but there were plenty that were as low as $14."
1291,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"For a quick bite of over priced comfort  food, this is the place !!"
1292,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Personally I'd head over to the Bellagio for a buffet, they cost a little less, and for some reason I still like the Bellagio buffet better."
1293,PRICE#NEGATIVE,This one star review is for the Bacchanal's terrible\/undefined pricing policy.
1294,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"He address with such answers: "" u don't know what type of food you like"", ""if you like burgers"" I almost felt like had revisited DICKS LAST RESORT..... 
Further, the food was your average cafe food priced as American bistro... Lame!"
1295,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I found the sandwich to be a good sandwich, but not the best I have had, especially for the price point (although this was in Vegas, so maybe prices in other locations differ)."
1296,PRICE#NEGATIVE,This would be a place for people who like to take pictures of their food because of the presentation but do not want to pay $100 for a la carte`.
1297,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Don't get me wrong the food is pretty good but overpriced due to the popularity and hype.
1298,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The food is 'spensive, unappetizing, and the seating uncomfortable."
1299,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Better value and excellent food quality can be found @ The Wynn buffet (our fave), The M (offstrip and a great value), Mandalay Bay buffet are better choices\/value."
1300,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"When we finally did get into the restaurant, I ordered the steak and egg sandwich, again very pricey."
1301,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"At $8.50 it's not cheap, but hey you're in Vegas; that's only one less hand of blackjack to play."
1302,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"However, for the amount you pay, I'd rather be served a meal that they spend time cooking and amending if needed according to my taste."
1303,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Here's the deal: you pay $40 for decent decor, a wide selection of food, and an excellent desert bar."
1304,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I don't think the quality of the buffet justifies the $50 price point, but it is worth a try if you're in Vegas, plus it's the new ""must go-to"" buffet."
1305,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Yes, this is an expensive buffet."
1306,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"After tasting the food I had waited so long for, and paid so much for (It was an Easter buffet or something at the time), I was really not blown away."
1307,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Its also pretty expensive, but if you come hungry and enjoy eating crab legs\/shrimp\/prime rib\/all food, you'll have yourself a good time."
1308,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Most notably - the dessert - I don't even have a sweet tooth, but I'd say the dessert offerings alone warranted the price alone."
1309,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"This is by far the most over-rated, over-hyped, over-priced buffet ever!"
1310,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Vegas strip prices for okay food.
1311,PRICE#NEGATIVE,The fries were a bit crisper than most but for $8 they should blow your mind away.
1312,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Price is high.
1313,PRICE#NEGATIVE,The food is good for the price and the portions are huge.
1314,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I wasn't too impressed for the $50 price I had to pay for the dinner buffet.
1315,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"However, $50 plus tax for just some good desserts, I'd rather spend extra to go to Bacchanal or spend much less at Rio which has more selection, fresher and more flavorful food with their basic buffet."
1316,PRICE#NEGATIVE,The pasta didn't taste the same so my second visit was a bit disappointing especially after I paid $25 extra per person for not waiting for 4 hours.
1317,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"- Sweet Potato Fries: Yummy and sweet but by the time I had been through the lines and got to eat it, it was cold ):
- Mac and Cheese: Why would I get mac n cheese at a 45-dollar buffet?"
1318,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Caesar's Palace can pretty much charge whatever they want.
1319,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Honestly, such buffet price over $50 per person, I would expect it to be restaurant quality food instead of buffet quality food."
1320,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I also got a coke for $4.
1321,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"We (my boyfriend and I, both in our 30's from Silicon Valley) stayed at the Bellagio across the street and were not happy with the prices and atmosphere in our hotel."
1322,PRICE#NEGATIVE,why pay so much and also get [slightly above] mediocre food?
1323,PRICE#NEGATIVE,There is a catch....the price you pay to get in can buy you the same type of meal (slightly better quality) without the variety.
1324,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Prolly ain't coming back though, the quality and quantity of food served ain't $25 worthy."
1325,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Price is high, its a bit cramped at times and there is a horde of tourists outside, but a fun place to say you've gone to."
1326,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The prices are on par with the rest of the burger places in Vegas however if you're trying to save on some money, skip the drinks and play some slots right outside for a free one."
1327,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The decor in here is very inviting and warm so it's a pleasant place to just eat in however for the prices charged I think it still has some work to do as I've encountered cheaper buffets with better food, thankfully this was a comped meal."
1328,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I wanted to dispute the charge, but the husband was done and really didn't want to wait around for the server any longer."
1329,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I can get a foot long at Subway for $5, but the taste of the sandwiches makes up for the cost and are probably proportionate portion sizes for what we should all eat for a sandwich."
1330,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"All in all, nothing WOW'd me, and for $38, I'm not sure if I'd likely go back...but if you're looking for a traditional Vegas buffet to go to, this is still probably towards the top of my list."
1331,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Barely an apology for making me so uncomfortable after spending a ton of money at their restaurant.
1332,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"(Side note -- I had free passes to the buffet thanks to my Cosmopolitan rewards program, so I got to experience both breakfast and dinner at no cost -- sweet!"
1333,PRICE#NEGATIVE,The price is adjusted with the demand and it's not really set.
1334,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"We had ate at the Bellagio for breakfast, and to be completely honest with you, I would rather pay 35 bucks to eat breakfast at the bellagio buffet rather than waste it at the wynn!!!"
1335,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"If it was about 7 bucks less, I would have absolutely no complaints about this buffet!"
1336,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Display \/ Information: 2\/10, signs on the wrong food, had no idea of what some dishes were & overheard a waiter ask if they were doing brunch or breakfast that day, so they weren't even sure, but they still charged $40."
1337,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I don't understand how I place like the Wynn, as pricey as it is, can't figure out how to keep their buffet food warm."
1338,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"For 19.95 , I would rather  go to WYNN Buffet."
1339,PRICE#NEGATIVE,It's more expensive than other buffets but it's so worth it.
1340,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"With that amount we could've gone to a very fancy and delicious french, italian or stake restaurant."
1341,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I'm not typically a fan of buffets, as I feel that I'm forced to overeat and I don't think I eat enough to justify the costs of a buffet."
1342,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Honestly nothing special, food was okay but over priced like everything else on the strip."
1343,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Price: About $40\/person (cheaper if you're a rewards member)

Food: For a different and unique Vegas buffet, I'd highly recommend Wicked Spoon."
1344,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"One of the dishes was from the chef's special menu, and it was the khaoi saoi crispy duck curry (again, it had very little duck in it, and we paid almost $30 for it)."
1345,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Ringing in at $25 for the lunch, the Encore Buffet ain't cheap."
1346,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Its a bit pricey for a Vegas Breakfast but worth it.
1347,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Oh - by the way ... probably the most expensive breakfast on the strip.
1348,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Great sandwiches, just wish the prices were not strip prices."
1349,PRICE#NEGATIVE,You'll get the same breakfast quality at a Denny's or Chompies at a much better price.
1350,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I would of thought , they would of taken at least a few dollars off , since there was no meat ..."
1351,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Food isnt bad but just not worth the money and the experience.
1352,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I wouldn't come back as there are other better choices for food at that price range in Vegas.
1353,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Yes, prices border on the outrageous, but the restaurant is on prime real estate and again, the place has no sense of portion control."
1354,PRICE#NEGATIVE,After eating at Wicked Spoon which charges $27 for dinner one would think the Wynn would offer something spectacular.
1355,PRICE#NEGATIVE,The lunch buffet ran about $30 but there's a great selection of food.
1356,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Highlights were the gelato, tofu with coconut and Cinnamon French toast, but for $22 (lunch) there is zero doubt in my mind that the M Resort Buffet beats this place hands down."
1357,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Usual stuff like the omelet station was available, though for that coin I'd have liked to see more high-end stuff."
1358,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"i felt for this amount of money, the hype, the length of time, the mediocre service, and the quality of food, and lack of options- they deserve only one star."
1359,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Be warned- those drinks are all about $2 more than the actual menu prices for them when you are seated.
1360,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"At around 37 bucks a pop for weekend dinner buffet, being a vegetarian...it's totally NOT worth it."
1361,PRICE#NEGATIVE,They can be a little pricey around $13 for mine I think.
1362,PRICE#NEGATIVE,The place is pretty expensive so make sure you go in with a huge appetite.
1363,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I think for now, I'm going to say the Bellagio Buffet would probably be a better value."
1364,PRICE#NEGATIVE,You will be just as happy at the Wicked Spoon or the Wynn buffet or the Bellagio buffet for 20%+ less.
1365,PRICE#NEGATIVE,For the price of this buffet you'd think that it would have tons of food to choose from but no it was just average.
1366,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I don't know what is is about me that I always order the $30 steak and egg sandwich.
1367,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Bacchanal is pretty pricey and the food\/selections are just okay.
1368,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Overall, I would rather have one nice meal, than so-so foods at this price."
1369,PRICE#NEGATIVE,We planned on eating at a different place after so we decided to share a BLT sandwich w.fries ($16).
1370,PRICE#NEGATIVE,A dish that can be easily made at home shouldn't be $13 and most certainly shouldn't be served in a gordon ramsay restaurant.
1371,PRICE#NEGATIVE,with tip about $ 35 for lunch and $ 40 for dinner.
1372,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Wow I paid 110 on Easter morning for old food.
1373,PRICE#NEGATIVE,For $27 per adult it was an incredible meal.
1374,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Yes, its pricey but its vegas, its a buffet."
1375,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"No other description except for its price: $1,000."
1376,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Don't go to Cesar's cause it's much more expensive.
1377,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Mimosas on the pricey side though.
1378,PRICE#NEGATIVE,They also have a breakfast buffet which is like only $21.
1379,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The food is more sophisticated than other buffets, but it comes at a price."
1380,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Lunch is not bad compared to dinner but there are so many breakfast options to choose from that it does not make the pricing for the lunch option as appealing compared to dinner.
1381,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"It's pricey, but I think it's worth it if you come right before they switch over to the dinner price."
1382,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Otherwise, besides the ice chunks on the shrimp, I had a hard time swallowing why I paid over $60 for this place."
1383,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"First, this buffet is not cheap."
1384,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Some of the dishes were very dry(expected from an ""average"" buffet), some very salty....Ive had much better food at other buffets with this price tag."
1385,PRICE#NEGATIVE,It's steep for $62.72 on a Sunday night but they don't kick you out and we stayed definitely more than half an hour after closing.
1386,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Given the price, and the average 30 minutes of wait just for food to arrive, I would NOT recommend this place."
1387,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Serendipity's is just famous for its name and their food is quite awful (and very overpriced.)
1388,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The small serving pots are okay, and the macaroni is great, but for $40 per person?"
1389,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I have a big pet peeve about paying top dollar for cheap food and this place is exactly that.
1390,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I find the food a little pricey for the potion, but the service was good, the ingredients were fresh, and the lighting in the outside patio portion was AMAZING."
1391,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Overall, my family of five enjoyed our meal; however, after paying $270, we decided we would not visit this Resturaunt again because we were not able to eat enough food to balance the monetary compensation."
1392,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"After spending $270.00
for our buffet dinner, I had hoped for someone to just give me the time
of day."
1393,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"We had:

Sweet Potoatoe Fries
Frrrozen Hot chocolate
Shrimp Fettucini
Chicken Nachos

It was good, but I just dont think it was a $50 price tag good for 4 items in a place set up to look like an ice cream parlor"
1394,PRICE#NEGATIVE,It's expensive (but so is the Wynn buffet).
1395,PRICE#NEGATIVE,for the price.... poor quality food.
1396,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"We went for brunch on a Monday, so I thought the price might be less than on a weekend; however, it was actually higher than what I had seen online."
1397,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Won't be coming back and will look for Groupon buffets at other places.
1398,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"No lie,  save your money and go to Searsucker across the hotel."
1399,PRICE#NEGATIVE,But I could have gotten good eggs and bacon at any other restaurant for $16.
1400,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I prefer the excalibur buffet which has the same stuff and more kid friendly food for half the price.
1401,PRICE#NEGATIVE,We were there on 7\/3\/16 and it was special higher price on that day!!!
1402,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"At about $38 a person, I expected the dinner to be AMAZING and omggggggg, the food was incredible."
1403,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"No discounts available (believe me we tried)--I don't care how good the food was, that's cuh-razy."
1404,PRICE#NEGATIVE,My wife and me came here for our expensive dinner out for our trip to Vegas.
1405,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"But because the food is so good, you get past the complete lack of service... not sure why their are a few haters out there but I am fairly well traveled and found the food to be pretty exceptional, particularly for the price.... the only thing we did not love were the desserts... not very good...

...but the rest of the buffet items, both breakfast and dinner, where fantastic!"
1406,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Not the worst price I seen , more reasonable!!"
1407,PRICE#NEGATIVE,No consideration how much money people paid for this trashy experience.
1408,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Of course you pay a heft price, but in Vegas that's really not bad."
1409,PRICE#NEGATIVE,They charge an arm and a leg for food and dessert that is okay\/good...Not worth it in my opinion.
1410,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"If you don't mind paying more for arguably the best Thai food in America, then this place is for you."
1411,PRICE#NEGATIVE,The bill was a bit pricey but worth the price.
1412,PRICE#NEGATIVE,The value is there if your going to make 16 runs to the crab claw and shrimp table as most where doing with crab legs stacked 18 inches high on a plate.
1413,PRICE#NEGATIVE,It is very small inside for the price I was expecting it to be elegant but the station casinos have better decor than this place.
1414,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The only thing that was a bummer was that this time dinner was $50 a person, and last time I ate here it was $38 a person, so make sure to check if you're curious about the prices of that night!"
1415,PRICE#NEGATIVE,We expected to eat the best damn burgers but its taste awesome just not as fancy as I thought probably overpriced because it is Gordon's but he didn't make the burgers.. lol...
1416,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Here is the down low ...
-Place is massive,  well decorated, and welcoming
-The price caught us a bit off guard (then again, we are in Las Vegas, and dining in one of Ramsay's joint ... but after late dindin, we agreed it was well worth it!"
1417,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Its around $30 per person
but her parents paid for me, thank you so much Mr. and Mrs. F.

so this place had a lot of flowers, and kind of reminded me of alice and wonderland, i have no clue why."
1418,PRICE#NEGATIVE,It was quite tasty but the portion was way too small for $13.95.
1419,PRICE#NEGATIVE,$19 for my Gordon Ramsay burger was a joke.
1420,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Expensive, cramped layout, and the food is fair at best."
1421,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Prices are steep, but they really know how to cook up amazing food."
1422,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Burgers have NO sides, so I guess $15 for just a burger is a good price for the strip, but I am used to getting RARE burgers with fries or salad included for that much."
1423,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Cost is average to what you normally pay at buffets, about $45-60?"
1424,PRICE#NEGATIVE,And the crappiest buffet food for $597.11 for 12!
1425,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"We were sad to miss out on top shelf margaritas, but refused to pay $12 at a $44 buffet."
1426,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Overall, I gave a 3 because it was mediocre especially for the price."
1427,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I think you can get a better value at the buffet, personally) and one star for food quality -- it wasn't terrible, but you can find better in Vegas, especially at that price point."
1428,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Food also expensive and really bad
1429,PRICE#NEGATIVE,There's an endless amount of items and no matter how hungry I am I never really feel like I've gotten my money's worth.
1430,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"As you'll see from photos, the serving sizes are obnoxiously large...  the kids meal we got was only $6 and also huge."
1431,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Dinner, Could be considered pricy but the food was unique and tasty enough to justify going."
1432,PRICE#NEGATIVE,A lot of money and I just can't eat that much food.
1433,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The overall experience should be 3 stars, but I am taking 1 star off because of the price we paid."
1434,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I was charged 10.95 for Pad Se-ew and this price on here says 8 .95.
1435,PRICE#NEGATIVE,So went to Vegas oh we could go for a Bashlor party and I got everyone hyped up to go to the Bellagio buffet where I heard it was one of the best buffets rated in the world and I was really excited to go so we went out to Vegas did our Vegas thing and got everyone to go eat at the  buffet and as an avid buffet go or I would give this only three stars they had really good food but from the hype that I've heard and only having four options for sushi I was disappointed for a $50 buffet so if you want your bang for the buck explore explore explore is plenty of awesome places to eat in Vegas and this is the place I will never go to again
1436,PRICE#NEGATIVE,It cost about $45 per person and you can add an all-you-can-drink deal for about $20 more.
1437,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Only drawback are that it's pretty pricey and the line to get in for brunch was very long.
1438,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Though the prices are a bit on the high end side the food is really that good!
1439,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I would recommend going for an earlier meal to save some money while still getting to enjoy the great variety.
1440,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Wynn Buffet* report:
*From a vegan's perspective

Price: C- ($$)
The $45\/ person price tag is probably a steal for meat eaters, maybe even vegetarians."
1441,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Beef Penang - it was ok
Pad Thai - ok
Crispy Prawns - or whatever that expensive appetizer was called - ok

I am a person that likes to Instagram good food from places I like to eat."
1442,PRICE#NEGATIVE,At least paying a little more you know you get better quality food.
1443,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Every trip was completely worth the bill.
1444,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Ok...the reason that I cannot give this buffet 5-stars is because, despite being quite possibly the best buffet in Vegas, I still feel the this buffet is too expensive."
1445,PRICE#NEGATIVE,What a waste of money and time.
1446,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Kind of pricey, but it's typical for the strip."
1447,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The burger was a solid, good quality burger.... but no a $15 burger."
1448,PRICE#NEGATIVE,The only reason its 4 stars vs. 5stars is because I had to during dinner time and having to pay $50 really hurt my wallet.
1449,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I love the decor and everything but its overpriced and the food is subpar.
1450,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Pricey, but that's what comes with the fantastic ambiance and high quality food."
1451,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"It was a great burger, but the price tag doesn't support what you get (2 burgers, 1 order of onion rings and a drink = 75 bucks)... not this guy!"
1452,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Holiday buffet is approx $60+ and the food is indeed so so.
1453,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The service was poor, the coffee was cold, and the food was expensive and not worth the price."
1454,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Instead I just got the normal buffet fare.
1455,PRICE#NEGATIVE,The prices are a bit more than I normally pay for thai food.
1456,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"nope, very disappointed the wicked spoon is much better and a lot cheaper than the buffet here, sorry guys its the price that makes you want to like this place and not the food."
1457,PRICE#NEGATIVE,But for $38 I was expecting a little better quality and better choices.
1458,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"For the price around 8:15 pm, there was no crawfish or lobster & no cooked fish."
1459,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Interior is very modern but comes with a price tag of buffet almost $50 per person.
1460,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Price: At about $35 a person, its very expensive when you consider the quality of the meal

Overall: My advice is beware, it may not be as good as everyone touts it to be."
1461,PRICE#NEGATIVE,With no drinks and no desert the bill came out close to $100 bucks (tip included).
1462,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I wasn't happy that they marked up the price only because it was a holiday weekend, nothing changed with the buffet that I noticed."
1463,PRICE#NEGATIVE,You can find these same selections at a normal buffet and end up saving $30 a person.
1464,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I paid a total of $30 something for myself as I was hoping to really stuff my plate with appetizing food.
1465,PRICE#NEGATIVE,this location is 1-2$ more per plate compared to the W. Sahara one.
1466,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Plus, it was $52 dollars for a buffet that I didn't really enjoy."
1467,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Despite the arm and leg you have to offer to be seated at this establishment, I'd have to say the food is to die for."
1468,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The M and Bellagio are still my absolute favorites and if I do ever feel the desire to pay that much, that's where I'll head to."
1469,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"DO NOT order a drink there though, 2 mojitos cost me $30, which is worse than the clubs in Vegas and 3\/4 of the admission to the buffet itself."
1470,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"At $51 per person for dinner, it is a decent value for unlimited quantities of good food."
1471,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger and it wasn't worth the $15.
1472,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Not cheap, but you get gourmet all you can eat food!"
1473,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"In summary, novel concept, expensive for what you get, food choices limited compared to other Vegas fine buffets, and fairly long wait time."
1474,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"It may be very expensive ($40+ for dinner, I think?)"
1475,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The only thing wrong with it was I think the price was to high, for that price you can get the same food at another buffet for cheaper"
1476,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Usually brunch was 22 or something I heard so this was an unwelcome surprise, but we soldiered on and ate there anyway."
1477,PRICE#NEGATIVE,The only way I think it is remotely worth of going back is if the price is around $25 and there is no wait.
1478,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Let me just say that I have never paid $40 for AYCE buffet but it was SO worth it!
1479,PRICE#NEGATIVE,My favorite restaurant when I want to spend some money on good food.
1480,PRICE#NEGATIVE,great place to dine bit pricy -1 star little high price rest every thing great
1481,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The server wasn't too attentive to us either since we didn't order food, which was super overpriced as well."
1482,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The cheese plate was some $15 and included a tablespoon amount of Bluecheese, Brie, and some herb-laden cheese that I am unfamiliar with (oh btw, these are conclusions I've deduced, the waitress didn't bother to enlighten me to what the ""chef's choice"" actually was)."
1483,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I was kind of avoiding it for a long time because it seemed so ridiculous to spend a lot of money on a buffet, but I went on a weekday when the fare was lower."
1484,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Quantity and quality was below expectations for a $55 meal.
1485,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"We waited in line for 2 hours, and by the time we got to the end of the 2 hour line, we were offered VIP tickets to wait 25 more minutes for around $10-$15 more per person (on top of the hefty $46\/person meal we were already paying) or to wait in line for another 2 hours."
1486,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I got the truffle burger for $21.
1487,PRICE#NEGATIVE,There are better and cheaper options in Vegas!
1488,PRICE#NEGATIVE,They charged $20 for them to hold it and bring it out later.
1489,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Now I am not saying this made me feel like I would get sick but it was just not up to par with the rest of the amazing detail and quality of the rest of the buffet (nor was it up to the price) 

"
1490,PRICE#NEGATIVE,A green tea frappuccino is better tasting and 1\/3 of the price.
1491,PRICE#NEGATIVE,For the price I fork up for freaking frozen hot chocolate I should at least get decent service.
1492,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Dinner price - $59 (after tax), extra to actually eat on my own schedule $21 - total = $80."
1493,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I think it is a little bit on the expensive side for the amount of food that you get, but then again it is in a major casino on the strip."
1494,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Now, knowing that this establishment is owned by Gordon Ramsay we expected to pay a few extra bucks but ultimately decided to just share our food because we were hungry, not starving."
1495,PRICE#NEGATIVE,The price is a little steep for the quality of food there though.
1496,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The food although awesome, was expensive and we were charged for each cup of coffee."
1497,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"For $50, I think I am entitled to pile my plate if I choose, but management came around and literally limited the quantity of meats per person."
1498,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"It seems the buffet only gets more expensive, but the offerings have yet to catch up, to justify the increase in price."
1499,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I give it a three because for the price I expected more, honestly for that much I would have rather spent it at a steak house on a good steak from a place that I know would make a nice cut of meats."
1500,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Worth the splurge for the reigning buffet on the strip.
1501,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Yes they are more expensive, but the quality is honestly so worth it for what you get."
1502,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Pay the extra money, go to a nice sit down restaurant."
1503,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The rest of the buffet is good, but for this price range, I still prefer the buffet named after naughty cutlery."
1504,PRICE#NEGATIVE,We were initially surprised by the prices and thought it was because we were in Las Vegas.
1505,PRICE#NEGATIVE,Pricey veryyyy pricey food should be warmer more hot seafood would be appreciative the waiters was extremely nice
1506,PRICE#NEGATIVE,The prices on some of the dishes are a bit overpriced and small in portion size.
1507,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The display of the food was spectacular, fitting for the high price of over $60 for 2."
1508,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"The dessert section was superior to Bellagio's, but cmon we did not pay $46 a person to feast on desserts."
1509,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Yes, it's more expensive than the other buffets, but if you don't do Las Vegas buffets very often, this is worth it!"
1510,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"In the end, this buffet is not cheap--but it is not out of line, as compared to other buffets within a higher end venue on The Strip."
1511,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"I had to dip into my gambling budget to pay for dinner, and when the cashier handed me back my receipt, I was expecting a room key or something with it, because I seriously couldn't believe I spent $100 for dinner on a Wednesday, and I didn't get anything else."
1512,PRICE#NEGATIVE,If you want better food for a synonymous price go to the Wolfgang Puck cafe at the MGM.
1513,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Off the beaten path in an old strip mall.
1514,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Outside on the patio, where I ate (after waiting 40 minutes on a first-come, first-serve basis) there were booming American voices, and a lack of intimacy with street pedestrians that pervaded traditional French bistros."
1515,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Ambience not so great but definitely a 4am place to get some belly filling food.
1516,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,It's crowded because it's an affordable and delicious breakfast spot.
1517,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,What the restaurant lacks in ambience and location it more than makes up for in food quality and menu.
1518,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Finally they had the smallest restrooms in the buffet area which was like 3 stalls, so there was a line."
1519,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"There's nothing cute about this restaurant, nothing fun or unique about it!"
1520,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"This is a Marriott created hotel (NOT part of the City Center \/ MGM Group), it's got the Planet Hollywood hip feel to it, but man... the design was just to...CRAMMED!"
1521,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,The restaurant has a dark interior that I didn't notice as we sat in the area enclosed in windows.
1522,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,And then when we are seated in the back room find that they have several open tables while more poor suckers wait in the waiting room.
1523,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"OK, first let's dispel the rumor that sitting across the street from the Bellagio fountains indoors or outdoors is a worthwhile experience."
1524,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"At the Bellagio buffet, the layout is cramped and it feels like I'm in a Wal-Mart on Black Friday in Philly."
1525,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"The place was packed, not a lot of waiting space,we took a few spots at the bar."
1526,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,As you walk in you find a very simple interior - very appropriate for the Thai restaurant but totally not influenced by the recognition the restaurant enjoys.
1527,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Inside was pretty full too.
1528,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Once you walk through the maze-like route just to find the buffet (though the hotel is beautiful and worth the walk), your eyes fall upon some simple back-lit display of the buffet's name."
1529,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Toppings for the sorbets and icecreams were also in different sections even though most people might want to have access to a broad assortment of toppings.
1530,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"At first glance the restaurant looks rather confined, like a San Francisco or New York restaurant that struggles with optimizing its square footage."
1531,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,We walked around outside for a few minutes before realizing that the restaurant was inside.
1532,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"It's a little loud if you're looking for a more quiet, romantic setting."
1533,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,C'mon you have a huge buffet and the smallest bathroom!
1534,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"This buffet has the atmosphere of a cafeteria, which is a total disconnect from this high and mighty establishment."
1535,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"ATMOSPHERE:
I'd call it an up-scale diner."
1536,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Lotus of Siam has no neon lights or Corinthian columns and is unimpressively located in a strip mall, but the food speaks for itself--flawless in technique, exotic in flavor profile, and interpretative in embedding the culinary tradition of the chef's roots."
1537,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"...Bathrooms are a bit confusing, walked into the men's restroom."
1538,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,This place does lose points on the environment.
1539,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"OK they have this non-ironic crap '80s music playing, and these weird little uniforms on the staff, and the FUGLIEST wall decoration: photos of food wrapped up in clothes."
1540,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"The whole layout of their food sections is so compact that everywhere I turned, there was someone in the way...and please get rid of those stupid rope barriers between your meats and sides, they don't work."
1541,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,We were not crazy about our table location near the entrance.
1542,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Too small to crowd 5 people around.
1543,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,If you are that popular expand a little there was plenty of room.
1544,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,The dining area has no ambiance and the dinner music is way to loud and obnoxious.
1545,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,The bussers stroll around with big smelly carts with food leftovers between the tables to collect dirty dishes.
1546,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"To save a little time, we opted to sit outside in the 110 degree Vegas weather on their little patio area."
1547,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"The location was a little hard to find... it's on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan, but we had to wander around the shopping area for a bit before we spotted a sign that pointed us in the right direction."
1548,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Holding on to my last two stars for the long-ish wait for the food itself, the griminess, and the lack of options for breakfast."
1549,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Service is mediocre, decor pretty mundane and the location kind of creepy but the food more than makes up for it."
1550,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,I most likely would not go back due to the large crowds and I am not someone who can eat multiple plates of food.
1551,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,The rest of the restaurant is dark and uninviting.
1552,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,They really need a good remodel to compete with the atmosphere at Caesar's or Wynn (but the food is better at Bellagio).
1553,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Andddd the last part is, it's off the strip, and you'll need a taxi to and from."
1554,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Bellagio layout seemed more packed & noisy.
1555,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,The only negative comment would be the wait (1.5 hour )and waiting area (small)
1556,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,This location is located in the back of the Harrah's hotel which can be confusing because it notes on here that it is near the Linq.
1557,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,This place is a little pricy and it's pretty busy as well.
1558,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Our entire experience at the Wicked Spoon was top notch, from the welcoming staff to the excellent food choices, to the ambience."
1559,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"It was hard to find, but all the best places are hidden gems am I right?"
1560,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,It is a hidden gem because it isn't in the best of areas or plazas in Las Vegas.
1561,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"There is a dessert station, a crab station as well as an Asian food station but a great many of the main dishes have to be passed on your way to the carving stations which are at the end of a long buffet line ...so you have to walk along a buffet line passing several dishes that you do not want to get to the carving  station and at the same time blocking people who want one of those main  dishes and not the carving station."
1562,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Also slightly annoying that the restrooms are downstairs.
1563,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Restaurant itself was beautiful and presentation was cute with the little pots and things like that.
1564,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,their seafood drunken noodle & pad thai was HELLA good and i just have no complaints....except for the ghetto plaza its located in.
1565,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,unfortunately they have cut down their gelato selection to a quarter of what it used to be.
1566,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Aside from the food, the waitress was super nice but the ambiance was definitely overall super dark and a bit gloomy."
1567,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Bad location the garnish ruins the meal there's  no restrooms inside the restaurant 


Great music and fun environment  AMAZING BLOODY MARY'S BUT THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE SUCks bC OF THE LOCATION I would not go back"
1568,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Don't think this is a classy joint...because it isn't.
1569,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,The lights seem a little bit dim and it wasn't as bright as some of the other buffets (granted I'm using the Wynn as a big point of comparison).
1570,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Though an hour wait to sit in metal chairs by a constantly opening door in not exactly my idea of ambiance.
1571,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"The waitress said it was because the area in the greenhouse area we were in was the ""wind tunnel"" but it was still disappointing."
1572,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Unfortunately, the biggest problem I had with the place was the music."
1573,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,This place needs a major update on the interior.
1574,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Thank God we werent seated by that fire window of hell!
1575,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"So bring warm clothes like a jacket, scarf, hat as it if Arctic freezing and there is a definite wind blowing."
1576,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"It's located in a dodgy strip-mall consisting of massage parlors and shady looking bars, restaurants and all the riff -raff they attract but I'll gladly dodge a few bullets to eat here again."
1577,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Just come here after dinner and you and sit outside so you can still keep your hearing.
1578,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"I find the casino tacky and loud (not in a good way) with its performing dealers dressed like Elvis, Marilyn etc."
1579,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Bellagio's looks old and dark, and I must say, looks like cheap buffet."
1580,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,lotus of siam is located south of the strip in a sketchy looking plaza.
1581,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Now what we need is for this place to open an off-the-strip outfit so that us locals don't have to brave the Strip if we have a late-night sandwich craving.
1582,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Both the music and atmosphere , I had to yell to talk to my server and family."
1583,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,It is very small inside for the price I was expecting it to be elegant but the station casinos have better decor than this place.
1584,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Otherwise, I wasn't impressed with the style or layout."
1585,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Total hole in the wall but the food is very, very good."
1586,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"This is not the fanciest steakhouse you'll find in Vegas, but the food is delicious."
1587,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,This Vegas Thai place can be tricky to find.
1588,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Nestled among the slot machines and cheesy Vegas lights is this little food oasis.
1589,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,I did not really like the layout of the Wicked Spoon.
1590,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Only downside is restrooms are downstairs in the casino.
1591,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,BTW this is one of the LOUDEST restaurant I've eaten at.
1592,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"If im staying more than a few blocks away, not really worth the trip."
1593,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Very bad location especially at night.
1594,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,The decor isn't the least bit whimsical or special in anyway.
1595,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Lotus's location in a less-than-beautiful strip mall did not win me any points, but once inside, the restaurant is large and comfortable."
1596,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"They do have quite a small seating area and I'm usually not big on going down to the strip just to eat, but I wouldn't hesitate going back for more."
1597,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"We got seated right in front of Bellagio's water fountain inside, but unluckily, it started to rain so people outside have to kind of scoot the table in and ours were getting splashed by the umbrellas :[ 
I had one of the steak dish, it was cooked medium rare just like how I ordered, but it was a bit heavy on the salt."
1598,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,kind of a noisy place also not really a big fan of it.
1599,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Its around $30 per person
but her parents paid for me, thank you so much Mr. and Mrs. F.

so this place had a lot of flowers, and kind of reminded me of alice and wonderland, i have no clue why."
1600,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Expensive, cramped layout, and the food is fair at best."
1601,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,The only thing keeping me from giving this place 5 stars is that it REEKS  of cigarrette smoke.
1602,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,View was great but draft from AC made it FREEZING.
1603,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Yes it's in an odd old strip mall.
1604,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,The restaurant is in the lot BEHIND the GPS location that I got.
1605,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Service was great, except for people taking pictures of you and asking you to buy them at the end."
1606,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,The other thing I'm not a fan of is there indoor seating arrangements.
1607,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"It was a little too crowded for my liking, but still very good food overall."
1608,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"The waitresses and chefs behind the bar were not happy to be there, and the mood in the restaurant seemed more like a fast food setting; get in and get out."
1609,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Service by the hostess is not good, the place does not smell great, and the food lacks taste."
1610,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,I must say the lack of customer service probably went down hill because it was overcrowded.
1611,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Location seems very dark and stuffy but my husband really wanted to try it so I made the best of it.
1612,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Located on the second floor of Imperial Palace which is a random spot to be, HH is place you should defintely check out if you want some good food and want to avoid buffets."
1613,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"We went to the Wynn buffet a couple days ago and it was not only cheaper, it was better tasting and nicer looking."
1614,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Pros: all the staff were amazing and so attentive even though they were working in such a hectic and crowded environment.
1615,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"We (my boyfriend and I, both in our 30's from Silicon Valley) stayed at the Bellagio across the street and were not happy with the prices and atmosphere in our hotel."
1616,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,The layout is not well thought out.
1617,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,I will say that the buffet is a bit tucked away so it's a bit of trek from the casino floor and other restaurants.
1618,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Also, seating outside is quite good except one thing - there are manholes on the street and smell from them do not promote good appetite."
1619,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Also, the restaurant was quite noisy."
1620,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"I'm not a fan of the decor, but the food more than makes up for it."
1621,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,The thing I didn't like about eating at a buffet was that somehow the restaurant wouldn't look good as they would focus more on the buffet\/food rather than the atmosphere.
1622,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Don't know what it is but the decor.. total LACK OF..in these places puts me off.
1623,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"I gave it a 4-Star because the restaurant decor, the ambiance, and the entrance are a bit out-dated and stuffy."
1624,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"In the summer when its really warm, sitting outside on the patio on the strip, is just the best."
1625,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,decor and food much less impressive than wynn.
1626,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"But this place offers AFFORDABLE DELICIOUS french cuisine in the most adorable little French setting and includes a gorgeous shaded patio facing the strip, so You d@mn-well better expect there's gonna be a wait."
1627,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Not in the best area and kind of odd that it is in a somewhat abandoned strip mall, but once you enter the restaurant you completely forget where you walked in from."
1628,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Anyway...the food selection is great, but one would have to walk his\/her way to the food section."
1629,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,It was certainly not the modern and classy design we would hope for.
1630,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Don't be turned off by the location-- Lotus of Siam is worth the hype.
1631,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,restaurant is the least fav location as its so dark and depressing.
1632,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,The place was a little drab.
1633,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Our server was great, but the seating situation sucked."
1634,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"The location is a bit dingy from the outside, but you can't argue with the results of the food."
1635,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,The food was great but the location in Palm Casino was not the best.
1636,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,This restaurant is difficult to find.
1637,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"But, the indoor seating adjacent to the outdoor bar is NOT the best in the place...not the charm of inside and not the view perspective of outside and with a lot of traffic through it from wait staff and diners."
1638,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"The interior of the restaurant is not that special, and doesn't differs a lot from other restaurants (except from the firewall with 'fire-waves'."
1639,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,I didn't like the decoration but the food was super tasty.
1640,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,The restaurant's decor was cheesy.
1641,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Regardless, IMO they should have a separate To-Go line or something :P

:: RESTAURANT INTERIOR ::

The interior was pretty big!"
1642,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Parking in PH sucks though, I have to go through all the shops before getting to the casino."
1643,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Location: It's kind of in a sketchy part of neighborhood, Sahara Ave and  Commercial Ctr."
1644,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Located in an unassuming strip mall from the small door that is the entrance betrays the fairly large and decently appointed interior.
1645,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Overall the restaurant was a bit dirty and the food was average.
1646,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Their desserts section was on the opposite side of the buffet but the sweet confections were to die for!
1647,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"The food is 'spensive, unappetizing, and the seating uncomfortable."
1648,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"lotus is the best, great food and service - proves quality will always will over location"
1649,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"The restaurant itself is fairly small in Vegas standards, so be prepared."
1650,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Only complaint if I had to make one, the restaurant seemed a bit loud, it could benefit from a little less commotion, though it doesn't detract from the experience."
1651,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"FOOD - 3 stars...quantity makes way for a relative mediocrity
AMBIANCE - 3 stars...something of a pig trough in an Italian villa
SERVICE - 4 stars...they keep those dishes moving
TOTAL - 3 stars...accommodates our worst excesses...but at least for a fixed price"
1652,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,The place is disgustingly dirty.
1653,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,The atmosphere was bizarre and contrived.
1654,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"I agree with other reviewers, it's a hike to get here from the hotel entrance, and there's nothing in between, but once you get here it is pretty dang tasty."
1655,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Just very glad Bellagio gained our taste buds' confidence back after the disappointment at Aria's poor impression on not only ""so-called"" interior design, but also very bad service."
1656,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Excellent thai food in a out of the way strip mall.
1657,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,One of the cons would be the location itself.
1658,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"One bad thing on that day was a group of teenagers next to us of about 10 of them were so loud, obnoxious and they thought they were being funny at all."
1659,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"No pictures of the food anywhere, just Ramsey's ugly face on everything."
1660,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,They can do with turning down the music so we don't have to shout our conversations or lean into each other so much just to hear.
1661,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Having arrived to the sketchy(yes sketchy) lot that houses Lotus I waited very briefly outside for my 530 p.m.
1662,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,It is in a horrible location.
1663,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Finding this place is confusing and take more than five minutes from the main entrance to get here, this is common in most buffet in the strip."
1664,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"you can also drive 15 minutes off the strip to a much lovelier location, had the Benedict at both and found them of an equally delicious nature, and the service and ambiance were excellent in both locations too."
1665,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"the only thing that kills me abut that place is the decor, like seriously rip up the 10 year old green stained carpet please!!!!"
1666,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Decor was pretty bad - bright lights and in a strip mall but had a great table and really delicious food.
1667,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"The products are not the same (don't get the BLT Mary at this location, it's a sad attempt at imitating the real one in SD), the vibe is not the same, money put into staffing is not the same."
1668,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"We were confused by the neighborhood and the exterior of the restaurant, but surprised by the quality of the food and service."
1669,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Besides from being a little awkward, that little room holds alot of yummy little goodies in there, pick wisely because before you know it you can end up like me with a plate full of goodies and feeling sick to my stomach just looking at them."
1670,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"There's no bathroom in the restaurant (or so I was told by the hostess), so if the feeling strikes you, prepare for another trip back down the escalator and into the casino."
1671,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,It was super crowded so not much of an atmosphere.
1672,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"The decor is really pretty, set up nice, location is HORRIBLE."
1673,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Plus the heater wasn't working :[

We ordered the ABC burger [$16.50] with Sweet Potato Fries and frozen hot chocolate and split the meal which was perfect!"
1674,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"The price is expensive at $65 for 2 people for sub par food taste, quality, selection, ambiance, and decor."
1675,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,The ambience is whatever.
1676,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,The outside of the restaurant looks run down but the inside interior is so nice!
1677,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Weirdest name for a restaurant.
1678,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,The decor will keep you talking.
1679,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"The buffet at Bellagio had the selection but lacked flavors in most dishes, the lighting was dark and gloomy, the ambiance was dated, and the service...omg the service was horrible."
1680,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,My only complaint was that they played elevator music!
1681,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Although this restaurant is in a strip mall off of the Strip, every cab driver will know when you say the name of Lotus!"
1682,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"The strip mall itself is a bit old and run down, and the exterior of the place is not impressive."
1683,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"I did bring this issue up with the staff there and they all agreed that the setup is bad, but they can't really do anything about it."
1684,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"As for the downsides:  the plates were wet and smelled fishy, the fried rice was hard, the music was way too loud, and the hot dog buns were hard."
1685,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"One of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas, because of it's fantastic patio seating and views of the water show at the Bellagio."
1686,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"It was an unimpressive place, I expected more, but I didn`t feel that boom."
1687,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,The outside of the restaurant looks like a hole-in-the-wall type of place located in a shady\/seedy looking strip mall but once you walk inside be prepared for a long wait if you don't already have reservations.
1688,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"It's in a dumpy strip mall, but you're going for the food."
1689,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"As we wait for our meal, I notice the place is showing signs of wear, but I guess that's to be expected."
1690,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,The decor is relatively outdated and tacky.
1691,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"excessive amounts instead of quality

tough choice, food was a little bit better than average, the overall service was way less than standard and the atmosphere was not good."
1692,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,It's in the most unimpressive location.
1693,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,The big drawback to this location is there is presently a ton of construction going on in front of the hotel and it makes it very difficult to enter the hotel and even find the self parking.
1694,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Its the only place I found signal .
1695,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Do not be turned off by the Dicey looking shopping center, it will be worth it."
1696,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"It might be difficult and often times challenging to get into the restaurant because there's usually a wait, and people shuffling to get in or get out."
1697,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Oh one last complaint, there's only three locations and only the Vegas location is supposed to cater to everybody on the West Coast."
1698,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Not that the layout of the casino helps one bit.
1699,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"The food beyond makes up for the area, though."
1700,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"I will start with the atmosphere: it has a noisy bustling feel, and the ambiance is what you might expect i.e."
1701,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,There is a newer section to the restaurant that I am not as fond of for seating.
1702,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Maybe the food would have tasted better with a better atmosphere.
1703,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,They need to get rid of the street performers in front on the sidewalk...
1704,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,This restaurant is located in a strip mall in a run-down-looking part of town.
1705,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"I had trouble finding the restaurant on my first day due to the many points of entry for the Mile Mall, but the easiest way to remember is that it's right near the half-price tickets office."
1706,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"They should remake the food selections ASAP

Pros:
* Locating in Cosmopolitan
* Their desert is the only thing good there
* They put many of their food in small cup\/pan\/pot

Cons:
* For the subpar food selection they offer right now, $40+\/person is a ripoff (Don't come here if you like seafood, their selection is very limited; they use crab legs the same level as those in $15-$20 asian buffet places)
* Most of their food doesn't taste like $40+ buffet, it was so plain and basic
* Their ambiance\/decor can be considered ""OK"" if it locates elsewhere not name Cosmopolitan, but for such an upscale trendy hotel like Cosmopolitan, Wicked Spoon should spend a little more money on the restaurant's ""vibe""
* Our waiter was discriminative."
1707,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Dull and unwelcoming, like the food."
1708,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Gordon Ramsey's picture on the wall though was kind of over the top (at least that's what I thought).
1709,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,The music was bit loud so people had to talk louder to be heard which made for a very loud lunch.
1710,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"The location is a bit tricky since it's hidden deep inside the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan hotel, down a long, empty hall."
1711,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"I can't really bring out of town guests here anymore with all the strange activities going on around the restaurant in this bizarre, depressing area."
1712,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Only downside of the dinner was that we were sat in the furthest back table of the restaurant and the service was pretty slow.
1713,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,This restaurant was awesome it was totally worth the wait and the walking.
1714,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"The Bad:
- Seating is large inside but very tight."
1715,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"The decor is a bit over the top Disneyesque kiddy land,  It feels like an Alice in Wonderland set on steroids, and probably more cafeteria than restaurant."
1716,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Worst of all, there was the lingering aroma of garbage, the unique kind of punch-in-the-face smell usually reserved for hospital cafeterias."
1717,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"The restaurant is right off the Strip, so expect a nice long walk from the garage."
1718,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Its in an obscure, generic stripmall, but the dining room is busy, and very clean."
1719,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"As some other reviewers have mentioned, the location isn't the best, but the food definitely makes up for it."
1720,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,The only thing I do not like is the name...this buffet deserves something so much more luxurious and original !
1721,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,It's not hip or cool.
1722,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,It was a complete disappointment first of all we pay $7 to park to go eat at this place.
1723,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Other than the awkward, mysterious, FAR walk to the buffet, it was just awesome."
1724,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,The food is consistantly delicious and the staff is awesome.
1725,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Location\/venue: It's located in a seriouly shady part of town in a mall I would never go to alone.
1726,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"I love that it's so tasty, but I hate that there are no locations in OC."
1727,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"It's a HUGE space, but they have all the food on one side of the room."
1728,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"This place is crowded, but it deserves it due to the deliciousness of their sandwiches."
1729,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"6) 


Lowlights:
1) Seafood: This selection was disappointing...the king crab legs were not very meaty compared to other buffets I have been to."
1730,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Only for a specific occasion as the poor food quality, inconvenience of parking, no bathroom in the restaurant and lack of whimsical ambiance was not impressive enough to bring me back anytime soon."
1731,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"The service was disorganized, the place was ridiculously loud and thank goodness we had reservations or I would have gone bananas."
1732,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"It doesn't have the flash, design, or variety of the Buffet at the Wynn or Bacchanal."
1733,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"I give it 4 stars, minus 1 for the location and the noise factor."
1734,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Bellagio's interior decor was far lacking as compared.
1735,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Decor is basic, nothing fancy but food is solid."
1736,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,When visiting at night be sure to make a reservation and DEFINITELY arrange with your cab driver to pick you up after your meal because the parking lot gets a little bit sketchy after dark.
1737,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Not the same vibe as the NYC restaurant AT ALL, but the menu is the same (as far as I know)."
1738,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Funny this place is hidden behind a big building and you would never have thought to look for a restaurant behind.
1739,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,Definitely worth the 2 mile trip off the Strip for great quality That cuisine.
1740,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Sure, they admit that the place is a hidden away in a shopping plaza and doesn't look like much but that the food is phenomenal for the price."
1741,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"The location is inside a random plaza downtown, and it was a bit sketch at night because there was this homeless dude walking around."
1742,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,you would never guess that the best thai food in vegas is in some nondescript crappy strip mall a few miles off the strip but it is.
1743,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,You can definitely see the wear\/tear of the restaurant.
1744,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"The strip mall it sits in doesn't do the restaurant justice....

Quality Thai cuisine in Las Vegas."
1745,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Venue: It's in confusing area - The Quad, and parking was a hassle or whatnot."
1746,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Gourmet food, intelligentsia coffee, patio seating, amazing hash browns."
1747,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The room is so beautiful and the servers are good.
1748,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"THE MOST GLAMOROUS OF THE GLAMOROUS HOTELS

1753,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"), the service was great and it was a busy afternoon - and the outdoor setting was just what we were looking for that day."
1754,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Right across from the Bellagio makes an awesome outdoor dining experience.
1755,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"***Mon Ami Gabi is a very popular French brasserie though I found their brunch to be mediocre and disappointing; the restaurant has a great atmosphere and nice service though***

Mon Ami Gabi in Las Vegas' Paris has been around for a long time and it still seems to be as popular as ever."
1756,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Very romantic setting!!!
1757,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Décor was nice and unique, not plain and boring like other buffets yes its more expensive than other buffets, but its well worth it!!!"
1758,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"We arrived just before 3pm on a weekday, and were promptly seated on the very busy patio just in time for the first fountain show of the day across LV Blvd at the Bellagio."
1759,LOCATION#POSITIVE,It is a cute little quaint restaurant that really does remind you of being in France.
1760,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"now for starters, everyone keeps mentioning to go out and eat outside and enjoy the view of bellagio's water show."
1761,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"We walk in to find a low lit, cozy atmosphere with a little more upscale feel and clientele."

I enjoyed the ambiance, table sizes and music."
1763,LOCATION#POSITIVE,By far the most beautiful buffet on the strip.

1768,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"It's in Paris Hotel and right across from the Bellagio so sitting outside, the view is great~ 

I was craving waffles and the chocolate hazelnut one here was SOGOOD."

1770,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Highly recommend it and try to get a table outside\/the patio so u can enjoy the   View of the strip :)
1771,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The other food is good too, & it's fun to sit out on the terrace and people watch (since it's on the strip)."
1772,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Situated on the strip, in front of Caesar's Palace, it's a great location."
1773,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Better selection and quality and a cleaner brighter atmosphere.
1774,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Seating is fantastic, decor is wonderful, food is high quality but not the highest quality so don't go in expecting lobster tails and filet mignon steaks."
1775,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"But I admit I pay the price because I actually like the cheesy pink atmosphere, I really like chocolate, & I like the special treatment given to diamond card members."
1776,LOCATION#POSITIVE,We had a great view and a nice cool breeze coming thru the open windows.
1777,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Good food, beautiful setting, great service."
1778,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The atmosphere alone is reason enough to come to this restaurant, but when you add on fantastic food, your have a sure bet (please don't mind the Vegas pun- LOL)."
1779,LOCATION#POSITIVE,I would come back because price is good and it is convenient.
1780,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The fire display at the façade is gorgeous, and the atmosphere is bustling with noise, tv sports and gaming machines."
1781,LOCATION#POSITIVE,This location is convenient bc it's 1) right across from Marquee in the Cosmo and 2) open 24 hours.
1782,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Delicious food (great presentation too), friendly service, spectacular seating."
1783,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Other than that, pretty good food and great atmosphere."
1784,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Overall, their price wasn't that bad especially since they're on the strip and I was surprised they weren't charging more for their food, especially for the prime location."
1785,LOCATION#POSITIVE,This was a gorgeous restaurant in Paris casino.It had a wonderful patio that was great for people watching and the food was second to none.
1786,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Ambiance is lovely

Food is Ok, there aren't many choices, especially for sea food."
1787,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The place is cute, the decor is nice and feels kinda swanky... sans the swanky price."
1788,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The location was a little hard to find... it's on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan, but we had to wander around the shopping area for a bit before we spotted a sign that pointed us in the right direction."
1789,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The food came quick, but not too quick (didn't feel rushed), and the environment was fun, casual, but classy as well."

1796,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Among all the places I've eaten at it Vegas, this is always really consistently great, and when you mix in the outdoor patio experience - it's one of my favorites."
1797,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Luckily, they do have a large banquet style waiting room behind the bar area."
1798,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The atmosphere and gelato is remarkable.
1799,LOCATION#POSITIVE,It was hot but we had a nice view of the water show at Bellagio.

1801,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The atmosphere and seating makes you feel like you're in a high end place.
1802,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"But nonetheless, I really enjoyed the food, ambiance, and company."
1803,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"However, if you want to sample a number of different items, want some quality with your quantitiy, want to stuff yourself on nothing but crab legs and shrimp, desire a fairly nice setting, don't mind the wait, and are stuck on the Strip, then the Wynn buffet is a serious consideration."
1804,LOCATION#POSITIVE,They are open 24-7 and conveniently located near the entrance in between the casino and the walkway to the shops.

1811,LOCATION#POSITIVE,In the lovely Caesar's Palace.
1812,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The hotel looked amazing as well.
1813,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The atmosphere inside is good too....though adjacent to a casino floor it is not too noisy, not stuffy and pleasant to sit in."
1814,LOCATION#POSITIVE,You can see the fountains at the Bellagio from the outside dining area and by the Window.
1815,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"You should wait for a outside table, the view of the strip is fabulous."

1817,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Concept was cute but item choices were nothing spectacular.
1818,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"It's cute, very Parisian & with a great view of the Eiffel Tower."
1819,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"this was my second time eating here and it's still my favorite restaurant in Vegas.....I'm sure there are places with better food, or a better wine list, but i'm willing to bet they are buried deep inside a hotel or a casino and no matter how much you dress them up, and decorate the room, NONE can match the amazing ambiance of Mon Ami Gabi."
1820,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Just resign yourself to the fact that you will be dining in a big, pink restaurant and you may actually enjoy yourself."
1821,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The prettiest buffet setting you could ever fathom.- (not including the Raffles Hotel in Singapore)... ok not comparable..
1822,LOCATION#POSITIVE,This was definitely designed to be in the middle of the strip of Las Vegas.
1823,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"It's well lit, colorful, and elegantly decorated compared to some other buffets."
1824,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Oh the venue is nice and is what received the 1 star.

1827,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The food, service, and atmosphere were great and the prices were very reasonable for a restaurant right on the strip."

1830,LOCATION#POSITIVE,I wish I could experience the service inside because the theme is so cute.
1831,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"I love that its off strip, and that the people who know about it have made the intentional trip to find out what its all about."
1832,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The layout of the restaurant opens up to the casino area of Planet Hollywood, which is nice...and it's far enough from the casino that you're not entirely experiencing second smoking while you eat."
1833,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Dimly lit and romantic setting.
1834,LOCATION#POSITIVE,It wasnt full of senior citizens like some buffets usually are.
1835,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"now that i at of ""age"" i stayed at the wynn which is very nice and elegant."

1844,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"I'm glad we waited, it was really nice having the fountains in front of us throughout dinner and the weather was perfect!"
1845,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The ridiculously long walk from the taxi drop-off point will help you justify eating absolutely anything you want to once you get there, and the walk through the stunning interior of The Cosmopolitan Hotel is quite a treat in itself."
1846,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Inside it feels more like a French brasserie.
1847,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Food is kept in stock virtually across the spectrum of options constantly, which is impressive, and the overall atmosphere is classy without making you feel out of place wearing a tank top (which I was... don't ask)."
1848,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"AMBIENCE:

- Modern, new, chic, clean and elegant

FOOD:

- Selection comparable to Bellagio, M, and Wynn."
1849,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"I was very impressed with the cleanliness of the buffet line, it was almost spotless, the food looked beautiful, almost too beautiful to eat."
1850,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Despite the location on the strip, it's a locals place."

1856,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"There was an assortment of beautifully decorated desserts for days, a lot of the foods were presented in these tiny wire baskets and the ambiance is very warm."
1857,LOCATION#POSITIVE,It's clean and well-decorated too; I like the lighting and the wooden tables\/accents throughout.
1858,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"-- Artwork: Across the restaurant, celebrities has signed menus and given them feedback about how perfect their menu is."
1859,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"love the patio seating, great seats for people watching especially in the blazing heat.... but hey get some mimosas to cool you down.... they had a bloody mary bar which i thought was really amazing...they give u a plain bloody mary and you can add all your garnishes with a variety of olives, celery, all kinds of hot sauce!"
1860,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Service was bad, the food quite tasteless but nice decour and location."
1861,LOCATION#POSITIVE,You will have  a great view of the fountains from the Bellagio Hotel across the street.
1862,LOCATION#POSITIVE,I was very excited to try out this buffet; it was recently re-vamped and the dining area itself is beautiful.
1863,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"(BurGR)

Anyway, service was 5-star quality, atmosphere was really nice, and the food was totally worth the price, which ended up being like $25 for sharing three sides + burger with four people."
1864,LOCATION#POSITIVE,First off the ambiance was breath taking without completely killing the wallet.
1865,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The atmosphere is almost 5 stars in itself!
1866,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Also, due to the huge selection and division of offerings, the lines aren't long."
1867,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Atmosphere is fun & service is good.
1868,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The ambiance was very chic with dim lighting and warm colors.
1869,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Our view was excellent, looking out to the Bellagio fountains during performances."
1870,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The location isn't bad - inside PH, which is close to the middle of the strip."
1871,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The buffet is a far walk from the entrance, so that helped build up our appetites for the brunch we were heading to."
1872,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The dining area and the buffet stations were well cleaned all throughout.
1873,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Great food, great service, and if you can catch a spot on the balcony great people watching."
1874,LOCATION#POSITIVE,All the cab drivers know how to good to it and it was easy getting a cab back to the strip.
1875,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The ambiance is fantastic and the staff is always so friendly.
1876,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Usually during the busy weekends, it's almost impossible to get a seat on the patio, but if you're there during the week day, I highly recommend it, as you get an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains."

1878,LOCATION#POSITIVE,I'll go back the next time I'm in vegas for another frozen hot chocolate ( probably will share between 2 people)  because serendipity is so cute!
1879,LOCATION#POSITIVE,It may not look like much from the outside and the mall it's in is a little sketchy (multiple 'social rooms' like the Green Door and other similar places) but this is an excellent and popular restaurant.
1880,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The atmosphere is cool but the wait is about 20-25 minutes for a party of 2.

1896,LOCATION#POSITIVE,It was a long walk to get to but I enjoyed the different types of artwork and took a lot of pictures so it wasn't boring.

place for people- and fountain-watching on the strip."

1914,LOCATION#POSITIVE,I must say it's a damn good place for romantic dinners..the ambiance is quite classy and beautiful..the waiters were very friendly......the french onion soup and the scallops entree were good...........the only minimal complaint i have is it's a bit pricey...........we finished off with a White Chocolate Bread pudding dessert which topped all the items of our dinner....I sure recommend this place for romantic dinners at least :)

1923,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Walking through the swanky Cosmopolitan was definitely a plus.

I normally don't give 5\/5 but this buffet does deserve this score."

1986,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"This is a place that not only serves good food, but also offers one of the best places to watch Vegas."

2014,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"This place has one of the best steaks in Las Vegas for the price, whenever I have someone visiting from out of town this is on my list of places I have to take them, the view on the patio is absolutely breathtaking and you'll catch the Bellagio fountains at least a couple times during your dinner which is fantastic if you aren't used to them, but the best part about this place is definitely the steak I highly recommend the peppercorn one I order it every time and it is absolutely amazing!"
2015,LOCATION#POSITIVE,It was a pretty romantic place.
2016,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Part of what makes Serendipity an awesome little spot aside from it's signature frozen hot chocolate (and desserts) is it's cute little charm and that's where this particular Serendipity is lacking.

2029,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"We got seated right in front of Bellagio's water fountain inside, but unluckily, it started to rain so people outside have to kind of scoot the table in and ours were getting splashed by the umbrellas :[ 
I had one of the steak dish, it was cooked medium rare just like how I ordered, but it was a bit heavy on the salt."
2030,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The layout is pretty big and spacious.

2036,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Mon Ami Gabi is just across the street from the Bellagio fountains, in (you guessed it!)"
2037,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"I would recommend this place as a date place, especially at night if you want to watch the Bellagio fountains."
2038,LOCATION#POSITIVE,for food and spirits and finally walked out leaving a mininal tip after the waiter brought me an after dinner drink that was supposed to be hot....again...only mildly warm...and then I had to wait 15 minutes AFTER I was finished for the check...... ....it is a great location with cold\/lukewarm food and poor service....again...sorry I can't give this the reviews I read....just the truth here...maybe things will change....I felt disappointed.

2051,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Summer Time (oh, there is a song by that title) it is GREAT to sit outside and watch the world go by (the 1st, 2nd and 3rd world), Winter Time (no song title) inside is a bit dark but elegant (ok, some consider this romantic), and a bit crowded."

2054,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"You can read the other 2500 reviews, or take in these highlights:

2114,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"You definitely feel like you're in a much swankier environment than, say, at the Paris' buffet (though the food quality there is also good)."
2115,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Location: 5 stars
In front of Paris, across from the Bellagio fountains (like everyone else has said)."
2116,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"If you decide you must eat here sit on the patio, watch the Bellagio fountains ,get a mon ami margarita, and fill up on your frites."
2117,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The restaurant is very clean and spacious.
2118,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"It sucks that they have such an awesome location and awesome theme, but the service just ruins it all."
2119,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Would come back for the location but try something different!
2120,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Once we were seated the atmosphere was great, beautiful decor."
2121,LOCATION#POSITIVE,I liked the overall French feel of this place.
2122,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Friendly service and very clean I rate this place at 3.5 stars.
2123,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The Wynn is beautiful itself, but The Buffet is so pretty too."
2124,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Lots of colorful, neon tall trees, bushes, lights and all in color of course."
2125,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The Vegas location indoors is expansive compared to the NY location, with patio seating wrapping around the restaurant, as well as a To-Go window."
2126,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Cute and classy interior, amazing bread in the beginning, the escargot (which I told myself years ago I would never ever eat) was to die for, and just everything was delish."
2127,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Everybody in our party enjoyed the food, the atmosphere, the company, the whole shebang!"
2128,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The atmosphere is nice and lively great music not to loud but just right.
2129,LOCATION#POSITIVE,We still got a view of the Bellagio Fountain and the Strip.
2130,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The Buffet at the Wynn is one of the top tier hotel buffets in Vegas with a gourmet food selection in an upscale environment.
2131,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Classy decor and beautiful seating arrangement.
2132,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Most french food in LV is outrageously expensive and Mon Abu Gabi serves it at a reasonable price with a view of the Ballagio Fountains.
2133,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Right outside the Paris hotel and next to Miracle Mile.
2134,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Overall, with a view of the Bellagio water works and plenty of people watching, it was a pleasant meal and I'm definitely coming back to try the mussels in herbs and white wine sauce."
2135,LOCATION#POSITIVE,overall a solid spot for dinner with a view.
2136,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"With over 500 dishes to choose from and 15 chef specials that change daily, dishes are prepared in an open kitchen concept for customers to see."
2137,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Noise level was nice even for being in the casino, didn't really notice the entrance or casino the restaurant is between."
2138,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The food is very good, the prices fair and the atmosphere can't be beat!"
2139,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Awsome view of Bellagio water fountain, very kind hosts
Steak is very bad."
2140,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Got the recommendation from the parent of one of my students and when I first arrived at parking lot I was a little skeptical but once you walk through the doors, you're greeted with a nice atmosphere and decor."
2141,LOCATION#POSITIVE,I always sit outside where you have an incredible view of the Bellagio fountains while you dine.
2142,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The location alone makes it totally worth the trip.
2143,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The view of the Bellagio fountains is worth it though!
2144,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Anyways, the ambience is fun, modern and clean."
2145,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Came here for dinner on Thanksgiving with my family after walking by earlier in the day and liked what we saw just from a sidewalk view.
2146,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Their decoration are very nice.
2147,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The inside is totally different, big and nic vibe."
2148,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Easy to get to and decor fits the price tag.
2149,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Yay for convenient locations and delicious food!
2150,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The decor is simple and pleasant.
2151,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Glad they sat us inside with a view of the street since the street odor was not very pleasant.
2152,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Atmosphere:
The Wynn itself is beautiful and the theme continues for the buffet."
2153,LOCATION#POSITIVE,So we got a good view of Bellagio and the water show.
2154,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"On a brighter note, this location is well-lit and spacious."
2155,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Perfectly clean everywhere.
2156,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The service is on point and the patio is amazing to have brunch on!
2157,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Although it is a super cute place, they made us wait at least an hour."
2158,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Awesome selection of food, hip looking seating area, and delicious desserts."
2159,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Everyone really enjoyed the food, the setting and the service."
2160,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The first thing I noticed when we got to the entrance of the restaurant was how nice and modern the decor was.
2161,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"If its a nice day out, I would definitely choose to sit outdoors!"
2162,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The atmosphere is nice as well; it wasn't really loud or noisy so we were able to enjoy our meal, as well as have a good conversation while we were enjoying our after-dinner coffee as well."
2163,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Love this restaurant for not only the excellent food but also the view from their patio.
2164,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The view of the Bellagio Fountains is a nice backdrop.
2165,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"As someone from the South, I'm not accustomed to seeing them in places outside of swamp territories so that was pretty cool."
2166,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The decoration of the restaurant is very modern and fun.
2167,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The view of Bellagio Fountains while we ate was amazing.
2168,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"I do however,  like that even if you order from there to go window there are plenty of seating right in front of the place and Cesar's Palace."
2169,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"A wonderful brunch place that provides you with some of the best views on the strip, across from the Bellagio where we stayed."
2170,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Once I walked into the buffet, I was simply overwhelmed by the elegant dining atmosphere."
2171,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Yeah, this is definitely one of the good buffets out there with beautiful decor and simplicity of food items while executed well with good flavors."
2172,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Very classy and chill for a night out with your loved one.
2173,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Texture was to be expected for a French resto, same for the patio view."
2174,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Not cheap, but well worth the quality food, good service and magnificent view"
2175,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"What we got: yum x 1000, great service, great food, great efficiency, clean bathrooms, bright ambience (inside at least), okay parking and a fantastic experience all around."
2176,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The location is great and perhaps there were just gems on the menu that we weren't able to try.
2177,LOCATION#POSITIVE,I guess they don't want you to go to the bathroom in order to clear out to eat more and this is their subtle way to funnel you out of the buffet.
2178,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The coveted spot in this restaurant is the outdoor patio, but they also have a room next to the patio with glass windows all around it."
2179,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Large spaces dedicated to particular food zones, such as a seafood zone featuring the longest crab legs I've seen at a buffet, a Mexican zone, an Asian zone (not so good), hot food, and desserts, you name it, it was there."
2180,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Beautiful patio views of the Bellagio fountains..both daytime and nighttime.
2181,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The cool air from the restaurant was perfect to deflect the heat of the night!
2182,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Down to the facts:

Located inside Planet Hollywood on the strip."
2183,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Mon Ami Gabi is definitely a good spot for tourists taking pictures and enjoying view of Bellagio fountain.
2184,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Avoid this place.. (I know I know it's pink it's cute but not worth it) 

- the employees all look like they are tired of their lives and everyone else!"
2185,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The best part was the ambiance.
2186,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Place was still under renovation of some sort when we went today but they have managed to keep the place clean and organized.
2187,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"First off, I loved eating in the atrium (light, airy and classic), and probably prefered it to eating outside (who wants to feel like they're right on the strip amidst icky large groups and las vegas grime while spending a bit for brunch?)."
2188,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The restaurant itself didn't seem super large but had a cool, comfortable and casual vibe."
2189,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"When I slurped the soup, I could tell the sweetness and flavor came from bones\/meat  being stewed for hours, and NOT from loads of MSG many other places threw in to mask the sweetness."
2190,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"BurGR is set in a casual location near the front of Planet Hollywood casino, just off of the strip."
2191,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Good atmosphere with an open kitchen and comfortable seating arrangement.
2192,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"So next time you're at the strip and in the mood to eat like an emperor or just needing something super heavy and plentiful to soak up the booze from last night, look no further than the Bacchanal Buffet."
2193,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The atmosphere is great, they do a good job of pulling off the French bistro feel."
2194,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Wow....what a great experience....the best thing ever was the crab legs in hot soup....service was outstanding....the place was sooooooooooooo clean too!!!
2195,LOCATION#POSITIVE,I love watching open kitchens.
2196,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"We sat outside, which offers a great view of Bellagio's fountain show, as well as excellent people watching (love what people can get away with (not) wearing in Vegas!)"
2197,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"If you are lucky enough to get a seat on the outdoor patio overlooking the Bellagio's water show, you have really scored!"
2198,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Amazing view of the fountains, outside patio with mists and a nice breakfast selection."
2199,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Everything on the menu is fabulous love the ambiance and the service is always superb.
2200,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"On my trip to Vegas, we decided to eat at this particular restaurant because it was relatively close to where we were staying at and we wanted to try French food that didn't cost an arm and a leg."
2201,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"This is an awesome new buffet and the architectural construction, decor, furnishings, and interior design is stunning."
2202,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Overall, fantastique food in decent portions & good prices, visually stunning and beautiful french vibe."
2203,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The hotel itself is beautiful, if you have never been here, it's a must to visit!!"
2204,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The service was on par and the view is world class and classic Vegas.
2205,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Decor was nice.
2206,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Unlike others I could actually hear the music across the street while watching the light and water show.
2207,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The displays of the products are all over the store and there are so many items to choose from which are decorated beautifully for Christmas.
2208,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"It's probably a cool place to eat while you can enjoy the Bellagio fountain, but the food was just mediocre, nothing really stood out and nothing really to be sad about."
2209,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Can't beat the great food and the view!
2210,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Part of the fun of Lotus of Siam is the bizarre, strip mall, risky neighborhood location."
2211,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Since this place is located right on the Strip, it was extremely busy, filled with large groups of tourists and several bachelorette party gals."
2212,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"I would say the ambiance and service is good but the food for the prices they charge is just ok. 
Actually one of the best eggs Benedict I've had in Vegas was at New York New York in the Italian restaurant adjacent to the Lobby."
2213,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Looks really cool, plates, silverware good presentation was all very unique and cool."
2214,LOCATION#POSITIVE,I love how whimsical and fun it is when you walk in.
2215,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Elegant location, scrumptious food, and superb service."
2216,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Yes, it's a very cute and dainty place with its colorful fruit and flower decor."
2217,LOCATION#POSITIVE,oh yeaa.. REALLY cute interior!
2218,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Request a table on the patio so you can enjoy the fountains at the Bellagio.
2219,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"We made a reservation on a Monday night about 2 hours before, and got a great table - half inside, half-outside with a great view of the Bellagio fountain."
2220,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Ambiance: 5 stars for the ambiance.
2221,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Decor is average, but the chairs were comfy!"
2222,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The location is still great so I may just stop by for beer next time, never the food!"
2223,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Pros:
-Really new and the layout (esp if you're seated near the front) makes you think ""Oh shit there's MORE??""."
2224,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Ambiance is incredible.service was okay.
2225,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Great service, amazing view of the strip."
2226,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The food was delicious (especially the creme brluee), the view is spectacular (you're looking right at the Bellagio fountains), and the ambiance is great."
2227,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"I love how everything is set up, looks so classy!"
2228,LOCATION#POSITIVE,It has a very cool atmosphere and I can not wait until I get to go back!
2229,LOCATION#POSITIVE,You can't miss bright pink in front of Caesar's Palace.
2230,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Mon Ami Gabi is one of my favorite spots to have brunch in Vegas, sitting on the outdoor patio overlooking the strip with the Eiffel Tower behind me, enjoying delicious French food!"
2231,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Decent four star restaurant located inside Eiffel.
2232,LOCATION#POSITIVE,This place really recreates the feel of a Parisian bistro or sidewalk café.
2233,LOCATION#POSITIVE,It is a lively atmosphere with a friendly waiting staff.
2234,LOCATION#POSITIVE,I absolutely loved the ambience of the buffet as well.
2235,LOCATION#POSITIVE,I made reservations so we were given a nice table near the patio with a wonderful view of the fountains.
2236,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Outstanding ambiance, cocktails, view and service sums up my experience at Mon Ami Gabi."
2237,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"It is bright, airy and features lots of flowers, fruits (yes they decorate with fruits) and greens."
2238,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Professional job...can't complain... staff was pleasant...food was nice... view from outside was really enjoyable...winner.
2239,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Didn't have to wait long to sit outside (great view of the strip) and everyone left completely satisfied.
2240,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Even when it's cold out, this is the best place to eat as you get a really great view of the Bellagio fountains during your meal."
2241,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"While the inside is cute in some ways and what you come to expect from a traditional ice cream parlor, it seriously lacks ambiance."
2242,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"We went to the Wynn buffet a couple days ago and it was not only cheaper, it was better tasting and nicer looking."
2243,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"I have, however, try the Sunday Brunch at Wynn last time I visited Vegas, and I think one of the things that I liked about Wynn over Bellagio was the atmosphere."
2244,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"This buffett is very nice,and the decor is great but this buffett has always been overrated.The quality food is good,but many items lack taste."
2245,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The ambiance is still the same, great views of the strip and the people walking by (who needs to pay $75 for a show when you can see a guy dressed like a knock off Woody the Cowboy walk by?)."
2246,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Great prices, great view, great food."
2247,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Absolutely loved it as well as the pretty decor.
2248,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"My second visit here, Food was good, nice patio seating area."
2249,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Located across the street from the Bellagio with great fountain view.
2250,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The dining room was clean and well decorated in line with the rest of the Cosmopolitan hotel.
2251,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The incessant beeps and chimes of slots machines echoing near and far...

And of course the lovely parade of scantily-clad ladies on their way to the clubs."
2252,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Maybe the anticipation and the atmosphere of this adorable, doll-house like restaurant influenced the fact that breakfast at Serendipity 3 was my favorite meal while on vacation in Las Vegas."
2253,LOCATION#POSITIVE,It was just so pretty and nicely lit that sometimes you get fooled by how good your overall experience was just because the atmosphere was amazing... but decor aside.... the food was not up to par.
2254,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Very quick, good food, good wines, and your final bill will be much lower than other restaurants right on the Strip
The outdoor patio is all the rage but you will probably have to wait for a while
Indoor seating is very nice and not too noisy"
2255,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Mon Ami Gabi rewarded our patronage with front-row seats to the Bellagio fountain show under comfortable heaters (keep in mind this was winter time!)
2256,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"I thought the gas burning wall thing was wasteful but who the hell cares, it's vegas."
2257,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The place is so organized!
2258,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"This place is a souped up version of the long standing diners that feed the working, drunk and unruly of Las Vegas."
2259,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Either you got it or you don't and the food quality just doesn't match up with all the glitz and glamour.
2260,LOCATION#POSITIVE,I think the Bellagio itself is beautiful where as the food at the Buffet was just okay.
2261,LOCATION#POSITIVE,I love the glass decorations here and they made the place so much more prettier.
2262,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The decor is classy and they give you plenty of room to spread out, sit back, and stuff your face!"
2263,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Overall, the experience, ambiance, and food was pretty good."
2264,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Atmosphere was nice and casual.
2265,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The service was pretty good, and the few from the back of the water show is great."
2266,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Cool relaxed scene.
2267,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"It's located in a quiet shopping center, I couldn't believe how busy the restaurant was until I stepped inside."
2268,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The ambiance seating outside was very nice and the food was great.
2269,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Definitely a good place to eat and to have a nice interior dining view of their restaurants.
2270,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"BTW, it wasn't very busy but perhaps its the fact that the COSMO is still a pretty new hotel and maybe no one knew about the buffet?"
2271,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Instead of waiting for 2 hrs, we waited basically 20 minutes before having a table with a superb view of the fountains outside."
2272,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"1) Great service
2) Good and consistent food quality
3) Ambiance is great but keep in mind it is a cafe setting so it is a bit noisy
4) Reasonable pricing for Vegas center strip location
5) Beverage cost not blow up."
2273,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Clean, gorgeous attractive room, wonderful selections and plenty big!"
2274,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Awesome, upbeat and fun restaurant!"
2275,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Add a glass of merlot or cabernet and you have a blissful dinner listening to opera music from across the street.
2276,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Here's the deal: you pay $40 for decent decor, a wide selection of food, and an excellent desert bar."
2277,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Parking is very easy.
2278,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Friendly service, nice atmosphere, and some great options for food."
2279,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Love it  good environment .
2280,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The decor of this place is super trendy, modern, and basically a sports bar with all of the large screen TVs on all of the walls displaying football and other popular sports."
2281,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Moreover, the tables were spaced out in a way that I could really enjoy my time dining with great company, rather than overhearing the next table over."
2282,LOCATION#POSITIVE,All these deliciousness is set in a gorgeous room very nicely decorated with beautiful flower arrangements and pastel colors.
2283,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The interior of the restaurant is classy and full of varieties of wines.
2284,LOCATION#POSITIVE,My friends and I went there during lunch and stayed in the restaurant as they changed the food for dinner.
2285,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The ambiance of sitting out on the patio, watching the bellagio fountain was amazing."
2286,LOCATION#POSITIVE,There is a fire display at the entrance - really cool looking!
2287,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"If you do choose Mon Ami Gabi, just simply order a bottle of wine and order the children's Mac n cheese and watch the strip without wasting time with the food that only the most unsophisticated tourist would find palatable."
2288,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Fun, lively, always busy,  yet serious restaurant."
2289,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Food, ambiance, service, and people were all great."
2290,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The decor and lighting in the area was great (just like the rest of the hotel) and the overall taste of the food was satisfying.
2291,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Place was cute and modern and decorated with lots of flowers.
2292,LOCATION#POSITIVE,So this buffet has got to be the prettiest buffet I've eaten at.
2293,LOCATION#POSITIVE,It is fun to watch people try to eat the candy apple... super thick sugar coating... impossible to eat.
2294,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The place is cute if you're into girly stuff: pink, beanie babies, totes, chocolate, desserts, etc."
2295,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The decor is super cute and my girls and I were lucky enough to get a semi-private room.
2296,LOCATION#POSITIVE,I must say that the restaurant is quite spacious and surprised how packed it was.
2297,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The restaurant decor was really cool and hip (awesome that I just used that word, I know)."
2298,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"We could view the Strip and people-watch, but were out of the cold and wind."
2299,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The wait time was minimal- maybe 20-30 minutes since we got there early and the atmosphere was lively.
2300,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"We were there for lunch, requested an outdoor table because the weather was great and the view was good."
2301,LOCATION#POSITIVE,But good food coupled with great scenery does make for a fantastic breakfast experience.
2302,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Only downside to the restaurant is that if you get here slightly late, you might end up waiting a very very long line for an available table, so it's advised to eat early and take your time to enjoy the food and the street view (if you decide to eat outside)."
2303,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Beware - there are no reservations for patio seating so if you want a view plan to head over early and wait.
2304,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Off the strip location, but easy to find."
2305,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The good: 
- we went early for dinner @ 6pm so there was no wait to get in and no long lines (when we left @ 8 pm there was a decent line);
- the ambiance was nice, good floor layout for tables and easy access to the food lines;
- bottled juices - i think fresh squeezed\/juiced and very tasty (my fave was guava, also had strawberry, pineapple, and two or three others) 
- good variety of food to choose from, excellent carved meet selection (prime rib, rack of lamb, two types of sausage) and great seafood selections (oysters on the half shell, cold snow crab, crab claws and hot king crab), standard asian food fair, srandard pizza selection and small pasta area combined with the chef specials."
2306,LOCATION#POSITIVE,You can't beat the location and the lively vibe here.
2307,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"I loved the fire designs going around the restaurant, they were very cool."
2308,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Excellent service, reasonable Vegas prices for food that does not include french fries or gas bubbles and a great decor."
2309,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The room is beautiful as well, and the $50\/pp cost seemed reasonable to us, considering the variety - you could have a 4-course meal, and the desserts were out of this world -- again, small and manageable to try a bunch."
2310,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The inside of the restaurant looked nice.
2311,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Beautiful Views.
2312,LOCATION#POSITIVE,It wish very modern and doesn't look like you're typical buffet.
2313,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Think a romantic version of Willie Wonka's chocolate factory where anything imaginable is possible.
2314,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Wicked Spoon does have several appeals though--sexy ambiance, free flowing water, and tapa-style individual portions."
2315,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Overall, the food had some highs and lows but the service along with the beautiful views were enough to make for the beginning of a good night in Vegas."
2316,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The decor in here is very inviting and warm so it's a pleasant place to just eat in however for the prices charged I think it still has some work to do as I've encountered cheaper buffets with better food, thankfully this was a comped meal."
2317,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"First off the ambiance is great, lots of hustle and bustle going on."
2318,LOCATION#POSITIVE,As I hope you already know the Cosmo's decor is eye candy.
2319,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"It was close to our hotel, offered bottomless brunch cocktails (for an extra $10 charge -- fair enough), super impressive selection, great quality of food and attentive service."
2320,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Other than that, the view of the Bellagio fountains and your not-so-crazy prices, make you worth eating here."
2321,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"For the quality of the food, and the overall atmosphere compared to other restaurants, the price was right!"
2322,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The atmosphere is great here, the service is very good, and the food is generally very good."
2323,LOCATION#POSITIVE,They play some pretty great music too and the atmosphere is really nice.
2324,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Perks:  reasonably priced, outdoor seating, and no need for reservations for brunch"
2325,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The place is very elegant with a lot of charm.
2326,LOCATION#POSITIVE,It makes you feel like dining at high end restaurant.
2327,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"You have more than enough options, but the layout keeps you from having a deer in headlights overwhelmed feeling, a feeling I often have when confronted with, well, the whole city of Las Vegas, as well as just about every buffet."
2328,LOCATION#POSITIVE,- Beautiful views from the Private Dining Room.
2329,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"I would definitely go back here again....good food, good service, good view and good friends."
2330,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Solid restaurant, good service, good ambiance, but the food was nothing memorable unfortunately."
2331,LOCATION#POSITIVE,It's like the first thing you'll notice when you enter the mall from the south entrance.
2332,LOCATION#POSITIVE,This casino has stood the test of time and makes a solid commitment to old-school decor and sheer class.
2333,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Champagne is great, view of Bellagio fountains is amazing and the food and service is choice!"
2334,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The most unique aspect of the buffet is the setting.
2335,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The thing i love most about this place is the awesome views of the strip and the Bellagio foutains.
2336,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Anyway The decor is super clean and modern which gives the space an nice open feel.
2337,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The bread is very tasty, the service is fast, there are tv's on premises."
2338,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Had a nice table in a quite room of the restaurant which was very nice.
2339,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"However, its in a great location so if you're walking around the strip its a great place to have a late night snack."
2340,LOCATION#POSITIVE,I love the atmosphere- the nicely designed friendly interior...
2341,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The restaurant is set up like a French Cafe (go figure) and has a large outdoor patio that sits under the Eiffel Tower right on the Vegas Strip.
2342,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Great place the burgers and onion rings tasted great.Our server was wonderful,she helped us decide on what certain type of food she liked to eat with her husband..The restaurant was clean..."
2343,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Located inside Paris and across the street from the Bellagio, it offers one of the best views of the fountain show and is a fantastic place to people watch."
2344,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Quick seating and great decor.
2345,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Walked around planet Hollywood for only 15 min and got the text that our table was ready!
2346,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Cute little place, great service."
2347,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Loved the decor.. Super cute... Fast service... No complaints.

3) easy to get to meaning you don't have to search for it."

2363,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Wasn't sure where in Planet Hollywood Casino it was located but found it right off the Las Vegas Blvd entrance.
2364,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"that fire sign right outside their restaurant provides some bomb selfie lighting for them snapchat videos or IG posts, so that alone is a pretty good attraction lol."
2365,LOCATION#POSITIVE,I feel the ambiance and the decor.
2366,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"She makes the experience better, we order, watch the beautiful view of the Bellagio Fountain Show, and end our visit."

2373,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The eating area is nice for a food court.

2376,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Ambiance\/atmosphere was nice, probably a nice date spot."
2377,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The restaurant is not very big inside, but there is a nice wrap around patio that actually has more seating than what is  offered inside."
2378,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The inside is pretty roomy.
2379,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Great views of the Bellagio fountain if you sit outside.
2380,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The view of the fountains is delightful, the food is good, and the price was not too overpriced given the location."

2394,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"This place is beautiful, and not just for a buffet."
2395,LOCATION#POSITIVE,I'm not sure how anyone pays attention to the Bellagio fountain across the street with the amazing people watching opportunities right in front of you.

2397,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Presentation - 5.0
Flavors - 4.75
Service - 4.75
Speed - 4.0
Ambiance - 4.5

The servers, all attractive, wear short blue or gray skirts with matching top."
2398,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The restaurant is set up nicely and the fire decoration in front is cool.
2399,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Pretty decor and furniture, but food does not match up =(

Probably will not return unless a friend insisted on coming again."
2400,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"From the chic venue to the paparazzi-esque photographers snapping a photo of you before you enter the buffet (because clearly you will look and feel like crap after the buffet), everything is over-the-top and grand."
2401,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The restaurant decor is really cute.
2402,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Everything was neat and clean which is good and the service was good, but the food didn't have the wicked flare as I was hoping for."
2403,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Atmosphere including the people watching was mind blowing.
2404,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Ask for an outside table you get to view the Bellagio water show.

2406,LOCATION#POSITIVE,This buffet is absolutely gorgeous with its decorations and decor.
2407,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Service and ambiance are mostly top notch.
2408,LOCATION#POSITIVE,This is my favorite place for a relaxed brunch (non-buffet) with a view.
2409,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The food was ah-mazing, the decor was beautiful, the menu was unique, the service was exceptional."
2410,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Sit in the outside patio by the sidewalk rail at dusk, watch crowds of interesting people walk by while enjoy the ambience of las Vegas Boulevard in the shadow of the Eifle Tower, Bellagio,  Caesars Palace and other Las Vegas Land Marks."
2411,LOCATION#POSITIVE,It gives it a more enjoyable atmosphere to enjoy a nice French meal.

2413,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The decor is awesome, they let you keep the menu and the servers are very good looking."
2414,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"I find the food a little pricey for the potion, but the service was good, the ingredients were fresh, and the lighting in the outside patio portion was AMAZING."
2415,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"However, it is an overall solid restaurant on the Vegas strip that will get you good food for a relatively good price with a great view."
2416,LOCATION#POSITIVE,You'll get the view of the strip rather than four walls.
2417,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The place is clean.
2418,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"We made reservations for 8 people and they seated us in a greenhouse area, which has amazing lightning and a great view of the Bellagio fountains."

2425,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"In this case, I usually ask for a remake, but continue reading for the reason why I didn't..

AMBIANCE: Interesting racer\/diner concept."
2426,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Lots of open seating as well.

2429,LOCATION#POSITIVE,This place is a high end buffet.
2430,LOCATION#POSITIVE,View on the patio is nice and great place to watch the fountains at the Bellagio.
2431,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Cute atmosphere though!
2432,LOCATION#POSITIVE,90% of my love for this place was the view.
2433,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"However, I don't think you necessarily go to this restaurant for dinner to enjoy the food but rather the view."
2434,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Probably the most upscale thai restaurant right outside the vegas strip.
2435,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Obviously, it's a nice french restaurant and the service and food are top notch."
2436,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Best of all, if you're there at the right time, you are directly across from the Bellagio Fountains, so you get a show with your meal!"
2437,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Great people watching spot.
2438,LOCATION#POSITIVE,the overall look of the dining space is modern and comfortable with some big tables to accommodate large parties.
2439,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Yes, it could possibly be the most expensive, but the quality of food and environment of the place is fantastic."
2440,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Well, I do have to say the decor and view are worth it!"
2441,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"But once you walk in the door you are very nicely surprised at the decor, the lively ambiance, and the large array of wines."
2442,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Long story short and to be concise -- if you do enter and there seems to be like a big line, don't worry, the restaurant can hold a lot of people, and you'll get your spot."
2443,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Elegant, bright decor of flowers with clean, comfy dining furniture."
2444,LOCATION#POSITIVE,One of the best places to people watch in Vegas.
2445,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Came for lunch with my husband, we sat outside and the weather was beautiful."
2446,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Cozy atmosphere, sat inside and the tables are close but private enough."
2447,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Great location on the strip.
2448,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The restaurant utilizes glassware for much of their decor, which made for contemporary, yet comfortable ambiance, garnished with an array of the most appetizing dishes I have ever seen at a buffet - and I have been to many around the USA, especially buffets in Las Vegas."
2449,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"I loved that the dining room had more of a large restaurant feel than a buffet look, and that the portions were individual instead of shady looking trays of food that look like they have been sitting out all day."
2450,LOCATION#POSITIVE,You feel almost like you're in a lounge rather than a buffet.
2451,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Excellent service, extensive selection of wines by the glass, good food (especially the sides) and if you're sitting by the window or outside you'll catch a great view of Bellagio's water show."
2452,LOCATION#POSITIVE,We were super stoked that the Earl of Sandwich made it's way to the Strip.
2453,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"It was too cold to sit outside, but the bistro feel indoor was fine."
2454,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The ambiance is money - one should expect nothing less from the Wynn.
2455,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Within minutes, I grabbed it and began my wonderful evening of drinking Whiskey, eating an excellent Steak Frites Plate (French style Steak and Fries) and savoring a Banana Foster's Crepe........while daydreaming and checking out the beautiful Bellagio Fountain Show (5 times) and enjoying the cool people watching on the Amazing Strip."
2456,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Other than that, the place was nicely theme with nice furniture."
2457,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Good atmosphere, a huge wine cellar."
2458,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Lotus's location in a less-than-beautiful strip mall did not win me any points, but once inside, the restaurant is large and comfortable."
2459,LOCATION#POSITIVE,I loved the feel of the place and was excited to try the food.
2460,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The atmosphere here is fantastic.
2461,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The decor is amazing and the ambiance is radiant, but since we can't eat the plastic flowers let's just ignore this category and focus on the food."
2462,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Here is the down low ...
-Place is massive,  well decorated, and welcoming
-The price caught us a bit off guard (then again, we are in Las Vegas, and dining in one of Ramsay's joint ... but after late dindin, we agreed it was well worth it!"
2463,LOCATION#POSITIVE,But nice view so not really much of a complaint there.
2464,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The ambience was perfect for a romantic dinner.

2469,LOCATION#POSITIVE,I also liked the bright and airy décor of the buffet.
2470,LOCATION#POSITIVE,GREAT location.
2471,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The furniture that resembles a cafeteria or a hotel restaurant (there were also a couple of screens showing sports) gives it a kind of relaxed atmosphere and not that of a fancy gourmet burger place.
2472,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"So if you enter from the Miracle Mile shops on Las Vegas Blvd, be prepared to walk across the casino floor."
2473,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"- Dim sim was solid 
- Ambience was good: comfortable & clean 
- Food was constantly getting refilled 
- Good selection of desserts: Gelato, Crepe Station, cake pops, strawberries dipped in chocolate, egg tarts, assortment of pastries and fruit, etc."
2474,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The view is gorgeous at night, especially when the Bellagio water show comes on."
2475,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"On my first visit, I didn't realize there was more towards the back of the restaurant."
2476,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"I probably wouldn't come here again as I could just watch the fountain show for free and with an even better view, and the food is not worth returning for."
2477,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The reservation is for inside only and the patio, which has the best view of the bellagio fountain, are first come first serve."
2478,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The decor is hip fresh contemporary with a great flow, lighting and super cool staff."
2479,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The background music is modern and the perfect tempo for eating -- fast enough to keep you pushing on through your miserable fullness, yet mellow enough to allow for a relaxed feeling."
2480,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Highlights:
- Decor was very clean and beautiful
- 90% of foods were NOT served in trays but small tiny individual portions."
2481,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Still, we liked going through the maze that is the Quad to go up the escalator to the yumminess that 
awaited us."
2482,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Design is modern.
2483,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Food: --\/5
Service: -3\/5 (Yes, NEGATIVE 3 out of +5)

2485,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"What a beautiful location...on the patio, watching the Bellagio Fountains!"
2486,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The food was great and cheap and the restaurant has a cool vibe.
2487,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"In my opinion the food was good, the venue was excellent, and the service was below par."
2488,LOCATION#POSITIVE,French onion soup is a must Best place to people watch if you get the outside seating.
2489,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Huge elegant space dedicated to desserts.
2490,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"When it's hot outside, you can take a cone of gelato and bring it out."
2491,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The best part of the restaurant is enjoying your meal on the patio watching the fountains and people go by.
2492,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Not in the best area and kind of odd that it is in a somewhat abandoned strip mall, but once you enter the restaurant you completely forget where you walked in from."
2493,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"To get the full experience, ask to be seated outside and enjoy the view of the bellagio fountains (on a weekend expect a long wait for outdoor."
2494,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The design of the restaurant in also so beautiful !!
2495,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Atmosphere was comforting and prices were affordable.
2496,LOCATION#POSITIVE,It's so clean and modern.
2497,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"One thing's for sure, this buffet is beautifully decorated."
2498,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The restaurant is impressive looking, from the decor to the mini skirted waitstaff, but the food itself let me down."
2499,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The decor, the seating arrangements, the buffet layout, 9 stations of wondrously delicious food.. some individually plated, some AYCE.. give a plate to the crab leg guy , get a plate back of deliciously fresh, hot & steamy legs.. ;) The little sliders were AMAZING.. chicken & waffle portions... chicken wings, hot wings, drumsticks, onion rings, tater tots.. omg."
2500,LOCATION#POSITIVE,We all got a great view of the bellagio which was breathtaking.
2501,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Environment:
It's really cute, French, & romantic!"
2502,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Overall, the atmosphere is beautiful, and the food was pretty decent."
2503,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"I spent about an hour and a half there, slowly sipping my wine and reading my book while I ate, pausing every 20 minutes or so to watch the amazing fountains across the street (and the people watching isn't bad either :)."
2504,LOCATION#POSITIVE,I love the decor and everything but its overpriced and the food is subpar.
2505,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The buffet area was well lit and visible from most of the corners of the room.
2506,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Sat in the glass enclosed seating area with brilliant sunlight coming through.
2507,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Pricey, but that's what comes with the fantastic ambiance and high quality food."
2508,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The service was attentive, the décor was very beautiful... but the food itself was just ok at best."
2509,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Great service, nice atmosphere, food is not at all my thing - big portions of mediocre carbs and grease."
2510,LOCATION#POSITIVE,We were seated almost outside so it was still cool from air conditioner but also had the view of the Bellagio fountains.
2511,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Had to come to the area for a trade show and didn't get to stay at the cosmo exactly but you get to enjoy the luxurious buffet.
2512,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Besides the ambiance, I also loved the tapas style of dishes."
2513,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The atmosphere was lovely, the staff was great and the food was pretty good."
2514,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Which is sad since its fun to people watch the strip walkers.
2515,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Atmosphere is nice  and great selection of wine.
2516,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"For me, it was good enough and I'd honestly come back here again to fit the bill of a casual dining place that doesn't break the bank, which has nice views of the beautiful Bellagio fountains."
2517,LOCATION#POSITIVE,So glad Wicked Spoon was downstairs to where we were staying at the Cosmo !
2518,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The patio is beautiful and a great view of the Bellagio fountains.
2519,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The restaurant logo in the front on fire, literally."
2520,LOCATION#POSITIVE,This place is cute!
2521,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Great variety, lovely atmosphere and good food."
2522,LOCATION#POSITIVE,I can't decide if this added to or detracted from the ambiance but it's nice to see this chef and cuisine gettings it's rightful due notoriety.
2523,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Interior is very modern but comes with a price tag of buffet almost $50 per person.
2524,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Our bill for the two of us was less than $50 and we got our grub and drink on big...well, at least she did...kidding of course...kind of...OKAY...I am kidding."
2525,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The design of the place is very impressive with a nice view into the seafood section in the front and the pool if you get the right seat inside.
2526,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The outside of the restaurant looks run down but the inside interior is so nice!
2527,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Its a very nice, clean, well organized buffet located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan hotel."
2528,LOCATION#POSITIVE,And I appreciate the fact that each separate area has its own individual look and feel.

2530,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The restaurant is not very big but is a decent sized place that does not feel too cramped.
2531,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The food choices were pretty amazing & its spread out so that it isn't too overwhelming.
2532,LOCATION#POSITIVE,enjoy a drink and tasty food while seeing he town and the cleintel it brings in.
2533,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Price: you get what you pay for - order a few items, but bring a crowd, you'll need the back-up 
Atmosphere: whimsical and fun
Overall: Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll stop in the first night of the weekend, that way I'll have three days to finish the cake!"
2534,LOCATION#POSITIVE,I love the open and modern decor of this buffet and how easy it is to get around.

2540,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The Wynn gave me so many ideas (I am a flavor designer) I cannot thank Steve Wynn enough!
2541,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Located at the very front of Paris, it's the perfect spot for a casual lunch OR a romantic dinner."
2542,LOCATION#POSITIVE,I had a wonderful lunch with my girls especially with the impeccable view outdoors.
2543,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Looks good feels good kinda ambiance.
2544,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The presentation: epic...a tower...a Tower of freakin' Epicness.
2545,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The terrace is fabulous for any meal but no reservations outside!
2546,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Presentation and ambiance - the Wynn feels like you are in a country club with people who just got done playing tennis with wooden rackets and about to go lawn bowling.
2547,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Seating is plentiful, service is good."
2548,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"And all the usual seafoods, sushi, carved meats - the food was great, ambiance was fun too."
2549,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The interior design gives a pretty old school classy vibe, so even if you can't get a table outside, it would still be a great experience."
2550,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The presentation is spot-on, and even the tables, chairs, and surrounding decorations are very impressive."
2551,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Also, their porch makes for great people watching right in the heart of the Las Vegas strip!"
2552,LOCATION#POSITIVE,And I fell in love with the sundae-shaped topiary covered in lights that was outside.
2553,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The table set up and quality of the silverware made me forget this was a burger place and not a nicer steakhouse.
2554,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Great views (from the patio).
2555,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Modern, clean, open."
2556,LOCATION#POSITIVE,We felt like we had entered the world of Alice in Wonderland!
2557,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The service was impeccable, the decor charming and decently authentic, and even though we were seated in 100 degree weather in an indoor\/outdoor space, we were plenty cool."
2558,LOCATION#POSITIVE,I think the atmosphere is whimsical and ultra girly.
2559,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Definitely the best meal I had in Las Vegas 
Environment-my uncle said the environment was what he has been looking for for 10 years."
2560,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The price is very reasonable for the exquisite
Food and the spectacular view of the strip at night."
2561,LOCATION#POSITIVE,For the price I fork up for freaking frozen hot chocolate I should at least get decent service.
2562,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Fabulous burgers, fabulous service and great atmosphere."
2563,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Again it is to your advantage to be able to view the fountains
otherwise this is just another restaurant."
2564,LOCATION#POSITIVE,I would venture that it's the only place on the strip where you can have such a great view and good food at such a reasonable price.
2565,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The decor is fun as well.
2566,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"It was worth a try and since I was staying in Wynn anyway, I didn't have go to far."

2573,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Not only is the food absolutely perfect and delectable,  but the overall environment is great."
2574,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The reason I am even giving them two stars is simply for the view.
2575,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"In my opinion, the atmosphere and vibe of the restaurant was amazing."
2576,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The +'s:
+ Great outdoor sidewalk cafe with plenty of shade to kill that relentless heat
+ Great people watching for those crossing Caesar's Palace
+ Great for large groups but place can get crowded at peak times."
2577,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Their buffet is also clean and organized as well than most I've been to.
2578,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The location is pretty good, Paris casino right in front of the Bellagio fountains."

2585,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The buffet is new so the decor and ambiance was nice.
2586,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Positives:  the decor was very nice and the wait staff was very friendly and timely, no line and was seated immediately(Thursday night), the shrimp ceviche, prime rib, baked salmon, and several of the pasta dishes were very good."
2587,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"But for it's location on the strip, being open 24 hours, and the price for a pretty decent sandwich, I'm a fan."
2588,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Amazing food, great service, and even better view!"
2589,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Pretty funny watching the stragglers from the night before head back to their hotels early in the morning...
2590,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"only good thing about this place unfortunately is that it's in a beautiful hotel, but needless to say that they need to redo the buffet menu"
2591,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"Décor is great, service was excellent."
2592,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Decor is amazing!
2593,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The place doesn't look like much from the out side but its a nice casual atomsphere inside.
2594,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Ambiance: Very bright indoor lighting.
2595,LOCATION#POSITIVE,The view outside of the Bellagio fountains is really really good.
2596,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Atmosphere: Nice and intimate.
2597,LOCATION#POSITIVE,It felt like I was in a old fashion diner and the food didn't quite taste the same.
2598,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"My Friend Gabi,

I love your cute Parisian interior, your dim lighting, your knowledgeable waiters and your delicious food."
2599,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I will never love another buffet again!!
2600,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I don't remember seeing\/eating icecream...

well anyways, if I had to compare this buffet with the aria buffet, I'd eat at Arias ANYDAY!"
2601,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Overall, this may be a good place to check out if you and the squad are nursing a hangover on a Sunday morning, but I wouldn't go here otherwise."
2602,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,What happened to Bellagio buffet?
2603,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I'm so sad they were missing in action!
2604,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"What I'm trying to say is the Bellagio isn't bad, and if isn't bad is what you're going for, then by all means come on over to the Bellagio buffet."
2605,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"***Mon Ami Gabi is a very popular French brasserie though I found their brunch to be mediocre and disappointing; the restaurant has a great atmosphere and nice service though***

Mon Ami Gabi in Las Vegas' Paris has been around for a long time and it still seems to be as popular as ever."
2606,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,SERVICE - We all got our table and grabbed our plates of food.
2607,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I would probably go back in the future if I was over there, but I wouldn't take a cab and make a trip there just for the buffet."
2608,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I've tasted better buffets in the strip
2609,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Will never eat a buffet again after this.
2610,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I don't know, maybe I am the dumb one who made the mistake of going to this restaurant on Christmas?"
2611,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,My favorite sandwich shop at my favorite hotel!
2612,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"If it weren't for the buy-one-get-one free deal we got from the MyVegas game (normally $24 a person, but we got 2 for $24), I would be even more disappointed."
2613,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,It's also galling to me when I'm staying in the prole-ish rooms at the Wynn that I get to see the beautiful people from the tower suites waltzing ahead of me over in the VIP line.
2614,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"So, I loved going to the serendipity in Miami, but Las Vegas Serendipity 3 does not measure up."
2615,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Dinner - forget it, the line gets even bigger, so it's really important to catch a moment when the restaurant is not too busy."
2616,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"The steamed crabs is in that section and if you've ever been to bacchanal, you'll know that the cold seafood section at the front of the restaurant is the most packed section."
2617,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Not a big deal but after finding out about the cutbacks on king crab legs, then my other favorite buffet item ran out for the day, I left very unhappy.. and feeling jipped."
2618,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Nothing was really notable except for these crazy cheese puffs (which I ate several bowls of the way one eats a bowl of cereal).
2619,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,There are so many better restaurants to spend that kind of money on.
2620,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I have worked with enough Frenchmen to know that this is the way a French kitchen and service is to run.
2621,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,The first time I came to Wicked Spoon was during dinner and I didn't enjoy it as much as I love their brunch.
2622,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Yup, but not fresh, all frozen and bland, etc,

As you make your final decision here's what it boils down to: for what you'll pay ($60\/ea) you'll stand in line to get a large choice of pretty good buffet food self-served in a massive, fairly loud room."
2623,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,This place probably used to be the buffet to be at but Vegas has evolved and this buffet is not up to speed.
2624,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I would come back because price is good and it is convenient.
2625,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,This place will close down in less than three years.
2626,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,We have been there before and it was an ok experience.
2627,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Definitely a ""one time, did that"" kind of place."
2628,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Perhaps the pressure to meet the buffet's operating budget and metrics has lead to its decline in food quality and consumer's dining value.
2629,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"This place is overhyped and overpriced for being the ""BEST buffet"" in vegas!"
2630,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"If you're going to pay $50 for a meal, you might as well go to a five-star restaraunt and buy a steak."
2631,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"SERVICE:  


CONCLUSION: 
The Wicked Spoon is all hype."
2632,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"We should have shared something, we lament."
2633,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Turns out the only thing enjoyable was the snow crab legs which were actually sweet ( as compared to one's at the Caesar's buffet from the previous day, but at least the food at Caesar's was actually decent)."
2634,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"What a sad waste of money, I will not ever come back to the Wynn buffet."
2635,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"While the food was delicious,  I can't give Burgr a great review because my water glass was broken and the glass cut my thumb."
2636,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I suppose you can't expect it to be great when it's been sitting in a buffet tray and has not been made fresh.
2637,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I give it a solid B. I just wished for more variety like how Bacchanal has.
2638,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I paid $40 expecting the best buffet ever due to all these rave reviews from Yelp, however, once I was able to look at what they were serving, I was in disbelief!"
2639,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Worst restaurant experience of my life!
2640,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Yelp led me here with its great rating, especially for a buffet, but I will never go back nor will I recommend it to anyone."
2641,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I've eaten at some of the other restaurants there, and they must be running the second string in the buffet, because the food in the other wynn places is noticeably better, and about the same price range (though not all you can eat)....

Worth a go if you are a seafood fan, but also not worth going too far out of your way."
2642,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,First experience here and probably my last.
2643,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Needless to say I won't be frequenting this location again.
2644,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I am giving this restaurant one star because I had a remarkably unpleasant experience here.
2645,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,This was my favorite buffet and it went downhill from the last time I went.
2646,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,They are better in bakery next to my house.
2647,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Walked in with high expectations but I felt like it was just an average buffet.
2648,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"The seating is all very low for some reason, so if you are tall and have long legs, it feels a bit awkward sitting in the short chairs."
2649,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Because it was our anniversary dinner date, rather than getting upset, we passed the time making fun of our food."
2650,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I used to think the Bellagio buffet of 5-10 years ago was the end all of Vegas buffets, but in the past few years, the quality and impressiveness has seemed to go downhill a bit."
2651,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,The worst Thai Restaurant in Las Vegas.
2652,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I have visited the restaurant on multiple occasions.
2653,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"The only things that they severed  that I would even think of ordering at a restaurant were the mushroom & truffle soup and the red velvet whoopie pie

All things considered, I would much rather go to the Bellagio Buffet, save the $20\/person and get better food"
2654,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Bit of a let down Gordon, suffice to say we won't be recommending your place to any of our friends!"
2655,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Oh the venue is nice and is what received the 1 star.
2656,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"May be its better any other day, but my wife and I went there and damn it was bad."
2657,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,It looks like the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace fails to understand even this.
2658,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"This is my first buffet in Las Vegas, if this could be a four star buffet, then Vegas sucks!"
2659,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,The desserts were better than the other food.I would not go back.
2660,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Overall would not come here again.
2661,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"By the time I get to the front cashier (where customers pay), I was one sad, drunken lady."
2662,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"(Siehe Foto unten) Gehobenes Burger Restaurant 
 so kann man das Serendipity am besten beschreiben."
2663,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"It's your basic in casino restaurant, a cheapish place to grab a bit after you just lost your mortgage payment I guess."
2664,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I'm not sure if the line is for image or if they aren't staffed enough to manage the amount of tables they have in the dinning areas.
2665,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,My average 3 star review is likely more because of my food choice but in overall I'd be hard pressed to give it a 4 based on my rating scale.
2666,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I guess I'll just keep searching for a good Thai place.
2667,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Long story short, I would never return there and strongly advise others against it as well, the only reason it gets 2 stars is because the food was decent, service is terrible and aside from the general manager, management was very unprofessional."
2668,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,The overall bill wasn't terrible for the amount of dishes we got but honestly I think we will go somewhere else next time to get our French Bistro fix.
2669,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"What a disappointment, maybe we went in with high expectation, maybe we were just mad that we gave up our one night in Vegas to Wynn instead of Bacchanal.. nonetheless, the Buffet doesn't taste like it's worth the $40 price tag."
2670,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,If you are going to a buffet I suggest the Cosmopolitan.
2671,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,So your basically just waiting for nothing.
2672,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I'll just try another buffet next time :)
2673,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"However, when it comes to buffets, I leave full but not completely satisfied."
2674,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Not my favorite place period.
2675,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Not what one would expect from an upscale eatery.
2676,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I understand its a busy diner but more staff, better chefs preparing the food, or better time constraints can give them more customers."
2677,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"As upset as I was for attending this place, in no way would I take it out on other paying customers."
2678,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Lots of other good breakfast places on the strip, avoid this one!"
2679,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,This restaurant should be on Gordon Ramsay's show Kitchen Nightmare.
2680,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"The best part was the dessert, but it still didn't make up for the lack of cold dry food."
2681,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Sadly I didn't get the chance to eat the cool items that other people had like Beef Wellington.
2682,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Not sure why The Buffet at Bellagio is so highly rated.
2683,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"if you're looking for french food, i'd try to go somewhere else, probably not on the strip."
2684,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,This is a pretty fun little place - if you like waiting for 45 minutes and then another long wait for the food to come out.
2685,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I thought Vegas buffets were good and cheap..boy was I wrong!!!
2686,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"If this is the top tier of Vegas buffets, I'll stick to fine dining in the future."
2687,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"All in all not worth visiting, however unless you like quantity versus quality and are limited to Wynn."
2688,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Their salad bar is quite good, but I'm not at a buffet for salad."
2689,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,This place is not good at all.
2690,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,But not my favorite buffet in Las Vegas.
2691,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I haven't been to Vegas for a long time but as memory serves I thought the Bellagio buffet was one of the ""better"" ones out there but boy was I disappointed!"
2692,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I can honestly say, there are better buffets out there."
2693,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Overall, it was a solid experience but there are plenty of restaurants in LV and I'm not sure I would return unless I was starving and close by."
2694,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,It was disappointing to dine at this buffet with high expectations.
2695,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,All in all I was not impressed by the Vegas location.
2696,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"The food was okay, but not as good as I'd remembered, but the worst part of it was when I saw a large cockroach--yes, a COCKROACH!"
2697,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I'm honestly flabbergasted with the people who gave it good reviews.
2698,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Burgers were excellent and should be since it's their namesake ;-)

It's the kind of place I'm really glad we tried but I don't know that I'd come to again because there are so many great places to try when in Vegas!"
2699,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Honestly speaking this buffet is over rated!
2700,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Overall did not like the place.
2701,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,We weren't sure why we paid for lunch when majority of the food was leftover breakfast items.
2702,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,A waste of a LOT of money.
2703,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Despite that, I have no real desire to return to Earl of Sandwich... ever."
2704,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Had they never seen a buffet before?
2705,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Wicked Spoon used to be one of our favorite buffets to visit while in Vegas.
2706,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,They undermine the great business that it is.
2707,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Personally with fogo de chao in Vegas now, I wont return here."
2708,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Food:
I ordered the Farm Burger."
2709,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Worst buffet i've ever had and pad thai!
2710,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,It may not look like much from the outside and the mall it's in is a little sketchy (multiple 'social rooms' like the Green Door and other similar places) but this is an excellent and popular restaurant.
2711,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Don't get me wrong I don't care about spending money on things that are worth it........but I felt what happened to us that day was a complete rip off.
2712,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"However, I went back and it was a huge disappointment."
2713,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Every aspect of my experience at the Hash a go go was disappointing.
2714,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Other than that type of justification, I cannot fathom as to why this place is famous other than their dessert and frozen delights."
2715,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Do not get the buffet!
2716,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,the only redeeming factor of this place may have been the waiter we had.
2717,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I wont ever go back, I can get way better food for $44 and wayyy better service and not have to wait as long."
2718,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Had dinner here and nothing really special compared to Louisiana buffets.
2719,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"If you are going to spend that much money anyways (and don't eat a whole lot of food), I would spend a little more, and walk a little farther to the Top of the World at The Stratosphere for a much better dining experience."
2720,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Overall, since we rarely come to Vegas, we probably will never be back to this place again the next time we vacation because there are so many other restaurants in Vegas."
2721,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Def stop by this spot when you are in Vegas, you won't be dissappointed."
2722,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Same yourself some time and money and skip the buffet.
2723,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I'm not European, satisfied with minimal food decorated by a blank plate background."
2724,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,They server breakfast till 11:00 and they start serving lunch.
2725,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,The only thing that I love from this buffet was their little tiny cheesecake.
2726,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"If you want to spend this kind of money on dinner, just go to a non buffet restaurant."
2727,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Food was eh, nothing amazing that would make me change my mind about the poor customer service."
2728,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Oh one last complaint, there's only three locations and only the Vegas location is supposed to cater to everybody on the West Coast."
2729,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"fucked up my breakfast experience.. bad service slow service, others came after us and ate and finished before I got my meal."
2730,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"If i wanted to dine like that, i woulda gone to the local food court where they have panda express and a burger joint and paid a lil less."
2731,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"They should remake the food selections ASAP

Pros:
* Locating in Cosmopolitan
* Their desert is the only thing good there
* They put many of their food in small cup\/pan\/pot

Cons:
* For the subpar food selection they offer right now, $40+\/person is a ripoff (Don't come here if you like seafood, their selection is very limited; they use crab legs the same level as those in $15-$20 asian buffet places)
* Most of their food doesn't taste like $40+ buffet, it was so plain and basic
* Their ambiance\/decor can be considered ""OK"" if it locates elsewhere not name Cosmopolitan, but for such an upscale trendy hotel like Cosmopolitan, Wicked Spoon should spend a little more money on the restaurant's ""vibe""
* Our waiter was discriminative."
2732,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I'll come back to try their food and maybe adjust my rating.
2733,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Next time I will just walk to HEXX and enjoy the view of the Bellagio fountains instead.
2734,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I would be willing to come back here and give this place another try, but I truly was let down this go around."
2735,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"In general, I'm very disappointed at my experience here in Bellagio buffet."
2736,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Not what I expect from an upscale ""burgr"" restaurant."
2737,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,After something like that I will never go back since it makes me question the quality control that goes on in the kitchen and that is not something I wish to question in a place that I eat.
2738,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"The food and service was fantastic, up until an adolescent cockroach zoomed across our table during dessert."
2739,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,This was the closest I have ever come to walking out of a restaurant.
2740,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I just missed breakfast, and wasn't there for the dinner I've read about, so maybe I just hit it at a bad time."
2741,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Mr Ramsey I think you are a phenomanal chef and I am a big fan , but I am dissapointed with Burgr ."
2742,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Wicked Spoon is a much better buffet, but I went against my better judgement and decided to try something different."
2743,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"We have the buffet included in our room rate, but I certainly wouldn't choose to go if I had another option.."
2744,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"2,000 reviews+ and still a 4.5 star rating for something less edible than any random Quiznos or Potbelly..."
2745,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"My verdict - it has a few gems, but I would still far rather eat at a nice regular restaurant because the average of all the items was 'decent', not 'great'."
2746,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,It was also good just was not a 5 star meal.
2747,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,It was a complete disappointment first of all we pay $7 to park to go eat at this place.
2748,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Service was good but I much rather have went to Bachannal!
2749,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I am not getting what the rave is about....
2750,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"A little pricy at 50.00 a head,  but fresh with great selection."
2751,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"The restaurant was Ok, nothing really to write home about especially when you figure in the pricing of it."
2752,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"If you get past the gimmick\/novelty of small size food presentation, there really isn't anything special with Wicked Spoon."
2753,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Desert was the only part that was OK - at least comparable to other Vegas buffet.
2754,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,We asked if we could seat at the kitchen bar towards the back to be a bit warmer and They told us they won't sever at the kitchen bar but guess what they seated and served people right in front of our eyes.
2755,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"This was the first time in a long long long time that I truly did not want to pay for this meal, and I am never one of those......
To be fair, if I came here on a different day with some friends it probably would have been different, and there is a terrific view of the Bellagio of course, and maybe the food would have been fine and with a large crowd the ambiance would have been pleasant so perhaps this overall four star rating is accurate, but I only have my own experience."
2756,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"If you want a real culinary experience I guess you would have to go to a 5 stars Michelin restaurant, not on most cruise ships (the worst offender is Royal Caribbean) and not on the Vegas strip."
2757,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Came here for the first time on a Monday night for dinner, and I was rather disappointed."
2758,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Maybe it was just a bad order or just an off day...but seriously, I'd rather go to Subway and get a 5$ foot long."
2759,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,That is some lame ass shit my friend.
2760,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Now I know you're gonna say that we should've gone for lunch\/dinner because the food selection is better and blah blah blah.
2761,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"But other than that, I thought after a while the BurGR started to get kind of boring, and turned into ""just another fancy burger""."
2762,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I had high expectations going into the buffet, but I can say with confidence, unlike other places I've eaten at the Wynn, I would be hard pressed to come back here."
2763,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I guess I'll have to find  a new spot to frequent.
2764,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Aside from the decor and the aforementioned appetizer items, nothing really differentiated the Buffet at the Bellagio from other establishments."
2765,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,But for the most part I've had better buffets.
2766,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,This is one of the worst places I have ever been.
2767,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I'm glad I checked it out, but I don't feel terribly compelled to return, especially considering how many restaurants there are to choose from in that area."
2768,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,This time I have to say was the worst buffet I've gone to.
2769,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,$46.50 total bill.... excited to see it arrive disappointed by the lack of flavor.
2770,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I would have given it 5 stars but the fact that there is no bathroom is very inconvenient.
2771,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Already having a horrible experience.
2772,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I regret coming here with friends after drinking and the employees seem to just have had it.
2773,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I wish I went back to my favorite Aria buffet instead.
2774,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I won't be going back on my next visit to Vegas.
2775,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Wouldn't recommend this buffet.
2776,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,We just won't return to this location ever.
2777,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"They're all buffets with the same kind of taste and style, which becomes boring after a while."
2778,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I would try another location but not this one...
2779,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Bottom line - not worth the money or the hype...unless you love Asian food.
2780,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,This smell renders the whole experience of dining on delicious food unappetizing.
2781,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I don't know if this is to replenish lost salt from sweating 24\/7 under the  vegas heat or because they want people to drink more water and be full faster but i could not hang.
2782,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Short and simple, this buffet was decent, but didnt live up to the hype, and seemed like just your average buffet."
2783,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Save your money and go somewhere else.
2784,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I will not recommend this buffet.
2785,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"In the end, I'm still a Ramsay fan, I love his shows but I'll never come back here again."
2786,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I would recommend coming here if you're looking for a relaxing buffet atmosphere, but for the OK food and the price...color me unimpressed."
2787,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I think the buffet here was mediocre and overrated.
2788,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I don't over eat at buffets, I much prefer quality over quantity so this place was a ""may-jor"" disappointment."
2789,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"And oh was it all hype...

the food is just okay."
2790,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,For the wait and the food I wouldn't come back here again.
2791,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"All three of those times, the quality of food and service never changed."
2792,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I was quite honestly expecting an very nearly empty place with me, a huge spread of food and a sad waiter\/waitress."
2793,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I should have read reviews about this place before going.
2794,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Just looking ""pretty"" in a suit while his servers scramble to get orders in and out."
2795,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I will never return to the Wynn.
2796,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,It is unfortunate because I would have given 5 stars on the first visit.
2797,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,They definitely need to be told that they're all incompetent nincompoops at this location!
2798,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"We had plans the next day for a couple of events we paid for and couldn't even attend since we had to leave early and go to the doctors since they were throwing up and had diarrhea non stop, just over all a horrible experience from the belagio  Wish we would of just went to the rio carnival buffet like we had plan, now we know..."
2799,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"This place had a lot of potential to be perfect but the food was a bit cold, some stale and what really killed the whole experience for me was how awful their macarons were."
2800,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,This buffet is terrible and expensive.
2801,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I might as well have eaten at the Circus Circus buffet or Sizzler.
2802,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I wish I could say that i ""enjoyed"" a Sunday brunch buffet at the Bellagio, but am forced to say that the experience was far from it."
2803,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Neat experience, but not worth going multiple times."
2804,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"What a disappointment after I drive to the strip, pay for parking, only to be denied a decent table to sit at and enjoy my breakfast for 30 minutes."
2805,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"While the food was decent, the price cannot be justified for how mediocre majority of the stuff offered on the buffet."
2806,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I was very disappointed with the whole thing especially for the place and the price.
2807,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Wicked Spoon is the worst buffet I have ever been to!
2808,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,We had a horrible experience here last visit.
2809,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,such a waste of $ & tummy.
2810,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Of course, if any of those factors would change in my favor, I would certainly reconsider."
2811,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,1 word best describes this buffet: decadent.
2812,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I feel like the quality at Wicked Spoon, like all other buffets, has gone down with time."
2813,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Trust me there are better places out there.
2814,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Maybe I should have gone to the Bellagio or Caesars buffet as I left feeling unsatisfied.
2815,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Just not acceptable from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.
2816,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"We won't be coming back when there is much better buffet own the street at another mlife casino and the place next door, which is the place to go."
2817,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Was not the cleanest place in Vegas for sure , half of the stations were closed and  all the food looks like over cooked.Not much variety."
2818,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,For $54 you can get a much better meal in Vegas and not have to stand in a line for an hour.
2819,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,We couldnt wait to leave the place and it took our server a long time to get the check even though we asked for it like FIVE TIMES!
2820,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Not worth the money or the wait in line.
2821,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Please spend your money somewhere else than Wicked Spoon Buffet.
2822,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Had the basic stations, but compared to some other buffets in Vegas it was very underwhelming."
2823,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,The Buffet at the Wynn was is extremely overated.
2824,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Will not be coming back i've had way better tasting ice cream and shakes at other local spots.
2825,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Ceviche, pasta, and made to order seafood were the only things I enjoyed."
2826,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Our server wasn't hugely attentive but the food came out promptly and correctly.
2827,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Waited for this buffet to reopen and best word to describe it ""Dissapointing"" Overpriced and the food was terrible."
2828,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I think I might have to try the dinner, but as of my experience yesterday, I would not go back."
2829,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"From the start of getting seated to pile of plates sums up, BAD experience for us."
2830,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Not sure if I'll be running back soon - there are TONS of other restaurants to try out in Vegas.
2831,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Not bad by any means but not so great that I would want to make a special trip out here.
2832,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"when this buffet first open, I can honestly say I loved it."
2833,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,This location didn't have the same feel.
2834,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,You walk around and see all of the wasted food.
2835,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,what a disappointing buffet.
2836,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Gordon Ramsey, I suggest you have a secret shopper\/customer to dine in and see how horrible this restaurant is."
2837,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,So utterly disappointed with Wicked Spoon buffet at Cosmopolitan.
2838,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,for food and spirits and finally walked out leaving a mininal tip after the waiter brought me an after dinner drink that was supposed to be hot....again...only mildly warm...and then I had to wait 15 minutes AFTER I was finished for the check...... ....it is a great location with cold\/lukewarm food and poor service....again...sorry I can't give this the reviews I read....just the truth here...maybe things will change....I felt disappointed.
2839,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Nope, The Buffet did not do it for me."
2840,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Serendipity 3, I really really really wanted to love you but you failed me."
2841,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"maybe because Bacchanal fell victim to my cognitive dissonance
of a quality selection versus a variety of quantity."
2842,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,These both provide better food for your buck.
2843,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Maybe this place was just too fancy for me.
2844,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,We were unaware that they had a buffet special and came after the buffet hours were over.
2845,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,(Bacchanal Buffet was way better)!
2846,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I would rather go to the Rio World Buffet, pay less money and eat a larger variety of mediocre food."
2847,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Do yourself a favor and go to the WYNN BUFFET OR M HOTEL STUDIO B BUFFET instead.
2848,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I don't mind dealing with the latter, but the former really made me an unhappy camper, particularly because it's always been so good in the past."
2849,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,This is the most over rated restaurant on the strip.
2850,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Have you ever gotten an attitude or service so bad, it just ruins the whole meal?"
2851,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Maybe because I am not a huge fan of quantity of quality, but I thought for the hype the Wynn buffet carries, it was mediocre."
2852,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"For me, it will be a once only visit but it does offer a large range of options, especially if you have fussy eaters in your group & a restaurant selection is difficult."
2853,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,The food quality is similar to when Bellagio first opened.
2854,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I had to create an account just to share how disappointing this experience was.
2855,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Boy, I was really disappointed in Gordon Ramsay's  BurGR cafe."
2856,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,The gelato bar was actually really good and a few desserts were good but overall  I felt disappointed.
2857,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I dunno I tried the food and for a Vegas Buffet, I dont think I would go here again because it wasn't memorable and the service we had was kinda poor, meat was over cooked, and the deserts were ok, but were of mediocre quality."
2858,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"The only thing that wowed me at this buffet, is their fabulous flower arrangements and the garden scape!"
2859,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Based on other reviews, I might give it another shot next time I'm in Vegas, but I'd rather go back to the seafood buffet at Rio before dining here again."
2860,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"If you have eaten any place that has been truly four stars or above before eating here, you are going to wonder why you came."
2861,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,We would avoid this buffet at any cost.
2862,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,We spent $100 and were really disappointed in our experience.
2863,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Overall, the Wynn isn't any better IMO."
2864,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"'From what people were saying, I was really looking forward to a stellar evening of incredible food to this new addition @ Caesar's Palace..."
2865,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"For about 50 bucks a person compared to al the other buffets in the area....it's better but honestly it's not worth it (but what on the strip is really ""worth it""."
2866,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"This was the favorite buffet of my husband and his family, but I felt it lacked quality non-seafood choices which dampened my enjoyment because I'm allergic to seafood."
2867,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Having dinner the next day at the Bachannal Buffet, it was a let down."
2868,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Unfortunately, my experience wasn't quite enticing or memorable."
2869,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Just as many claim it is indeed a diner with diner food.
2870,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,This place is OVERHYPED.
2871,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I would say try it for the experience but it's nothing ""that"" great."
2872,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,So I'd probably knock that down to a three.
2873,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"The service was good, but that's about it"
2874,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,It was good but not worth the effort or extra long line at that station.
2875,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"This resulted in me eating a little bit at a time, food getting cold while waiting, dreading going in line to get more food... My hunger went away but I didn't quite feel like I enjoyed my meal or ate as much as I could have."
2876,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I'm also very understanding so it takes quite the mess up to make me give terribly low ratings.
2877,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,We ordered over $100 worth of food and over all 2 were ok dishes - drunken noodle prawns and sticky rice and mango for dessert... For all the hype and what not really not worth it.
2878,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I wanted to really like this place... but it's way too touristy , too crowded and at not fault of the servers because of the crowds the overall service is lacking."
2879,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Normally you would think of a buffet as serving sub-par, dried-out food that has been sitting under the heat lamp for hours."
2880,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,All I am saying is don't be fooled by long lines and a full restaurant because it is a lie.
2881,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Honestly the Dinner buffet here was a massive letdown.
2882,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Unfortunately, the buffet at the Wynn does not make the grade."
2883,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"We really liked dinner so we were actually hoping that lunch would something different and good too, but it was really the same food so the second time was a little disappointing, mostly because we wanted some new stuff."
2884,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"If you're a regular guest, you feel like a 2nd class citizen here, more than any other buffet in Vegas I've been to."
2885,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"If I am going to pay buku bucks for a buffet, id expect everything to be up to par."
2886,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,No doubt Mr. Ramsey is a good cook and passionate but you can't always expect that you can have several restaurants that will maintain that kind of drive and integrity to make every single customers experience absolutely excellent.
2887,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Don't let the long line fool you.
2888,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Use to be the BEST in town
Now the FIRST PLACE is BACCHANAL at caesar palace
I do not recommend anymore the buffet
You would be dIsappointed
We could have thought that after beeing so good they would have make a special effort at the apperance of bacchanal
It is the contruary
Chinese food is not varied and no good
Meat is very poor
Pizzas are awfull
Salads and vegetables with no taste
Deserts are a désolation
Ice cream a joke 
Used to be a huge fan no more !!"
2889,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,This is technically a review update as I was originally working on a 2-star review for this restaurant (had dinner with friends during a bachelorette party and it was TERRIBLE for both food and service).
2890,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Wynn, you could do better."
2891,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Shame on such buffet restaurant!
2892,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I expected it to be expensive (which is fine because it's Vegas) but if this buffet was free I would not go back.
2893,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I finally got so fed up we decided to split our party of 5 into 2 and 3 and get seated at separate tables for faster seating.
2894,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I wished that we would have tried this place when it first opened because seeing and reading reviews from years back, it sounded so much better."
2895,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I can't remember exactly what is was called but it was insane.
2896,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Nothing special considering the price and the name that's attached to this place.
2897,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I've worked in the restaurant business and most horrible restaurants are due to poor management... Not coming back here again.
2898,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"If you want great food, visit a well reviewed restaurant."
2899,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Everything else was really not great at all.
2900,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"All in all, Hash House was good but a bit over-hyped, over-priced, and probably not worth the wait next time we visit."
2901,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Hash House has become a traditional stop for us every time we visit Las Vegas.
2902,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Would come back for the location but try something different!
2903,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Won't be a stop on *my* next trip to Vegas, but if you've just lost your shirt at the blackjack table, *you* may want to stop by this wallet-friendly Planet Hollywood eatery."
2904,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Again, why are Asian restaurants charging for rice in Vegas???"
2905,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,That was my first meal on this particular trip to Vegas (we go about 4 times a year) so I have to now find another restaurant to take this bad taste out of my mouth...  :(
2906,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,It's not hip or cool.
2907,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Maybe I set my expectations very high, but this place wasn't as good as everyone mentions and the 200+ people waiting outside for 2 or 3 hours would agree."
2908,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"This Buffett is not what you would expect from ""The best Buffet in the USA""."
2909,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Way too many good places top this so buyer beware.
2910,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Like I said, this buffet is good but it wasn't OMGAH amazing."
2911,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Overall:
I had such a lackluster and disappointing experience with friendly staff."
2912,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"This was our first time coming to the Bellagio Buffet, and after reading how it's one of the best, I have to disagree."
2913,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"The Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's Palace was a big disappointment, especially with a 4-star Yelp review."
2914,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Only for a specific occasion as the poor food quality, inconvenience of parking, no bathroom in the restaurant and lack of whimsical ambiance was not impressive enough to bring me back anytime soon."
2915,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I honestly have no idea why people think this a good buffet.
2916,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"For that amount of money, I was expecting something that eluded excellence from the very first sip."
2917,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"It's more of a ""food factory"" than it is a satisfying overall dining or culinary experience."
2918,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I would have no complaints about the increased holiday prices if this included more items on the menu or even the same number of items.
2919,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"People should try other places to get the better deal, overall."
2920,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"After seeing Bacchanal on several food documentaries and hearing how amazing it was from word of mouth, I felt let down with my overall dining experience."
2921,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Kind of bland
- Aparagus: Mediocre, nothing special 
 
Overall, i was a bit disappointed with this restaurant."
2922,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"So maybe it was my mind playing tricks on me after 8 years, but it wasn't as good as I had remembered."
2923,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,this place is so crappy there are no words to describe it.
2924,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Do not waste your time or money coming to cheap Disneyland!
2925,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"The staff wasn't really friendly either, and at $65 dollars a person I really expected a better experience."
2926,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"The full montague was pretty good but wasn't amazing, I was a little disappointed to be honest."
2927,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Seated at the bar gave me an excellent view of a filthy back bar area.
2928,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,This place used to be a great place.
2929,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I typically enjoy French cafes a great deal but this isn't one.
2930,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Still not enough time for what should have been a rather leisurely meal.
2931,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Hash House is perfect fit for Vegas - oversized, excessive, indulgence but really the experience is just mediocre."
2932,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,4 of us just came out of the restaurant very disappointed.
2933,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,not good for the price!
2934,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,vegas has so many great eateries dont waste time at any buffett...especially this one.
2935,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"But because nothing really impressed me, I don't know if I'd come back to put down more money for lunch and dinner entrees."
2936,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"No thanks, there are lots of places on the Vegas strip, less money for better services."
2937,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"And I must say, I like the SD location better."
2938,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,went back recently it was very disappointed for the money.
2939,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"As with any buffet, things are hit and miss, and consistency is always an issue."
2940,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"We had heard so much about this buffet and were really looking forward to it, but wish we hadn't gone!"
2941,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Wynn has much better buffet and they have their act together.
2942,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"We sat in traffic for 7 hrs from LA to Vegas so we choose this buffet to welcome us with great, breath taking food but it didn't!"
2943,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I'm not sure why people keep telling me this place is the best.
2944,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Skip the Wynn Buffet and get more bang for your buck and better quality food.
2945,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"But will I visit this buffet again, no."
2946,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I can see that they are trying to be different and stand out from other buffets and they certainly do - that's what makes them the worst buffet in Las Vegas!
2947,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,But I have to say it wasn't worth $65 a person for a party of 18 and you have to do the tip included  The food was ok on a Saturday brunch day with no mimosas (I though a brunch always or at least a nice one to offer mimosas.
2948,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,So that already ticked me off.
2949,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"People, save your time and money."
2950,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I have been to this buffet many times and the quality is getting worse.
2951,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"However, I was very disappointed by the Bellagio buffet."
2952,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"But, the service was exceptional--the only redeeming quality."
2953,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Heard so many things about this restaurant so we thought we would give it a try.
2954,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Unfortunately over the years I've watched this place just decline in quality.
2955,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,There are newer casinos in Vegas which cost much more money and have impressive restaurant credentials.
2956,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"So for $35+, eat at the Bellagio."
2957,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,So we just ate our sandwiches and left :(
2958,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"If you live in Los Angeles\/ Chicago\/ SFO with a wide diversity of authentic Thai restaurants that you frequent, you may be disappointed with Lotus."
2959,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Now at the express window they charge $11 for the smaller size!!
2960,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Price: Relatively expensive, not worth it in my opinion."
2961,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"After all that shit, I think I would rather have been mugged by an overpriced yet decent restaurant run by some random celebrity chef in one of countless hotels on the strip and it probably would have tasted better than eating here."
2962,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"but when I go back to Vegas, i don't think i'd be visiting bellagio's buffet as first choice..."
2963,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,We ordered seven items and asked the server to space them out.
2964,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Nothing special, even though it is The Bellagio Cafe."
2965,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I think restaurants like this should at least have basics down!
2966,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"The desserts were good, the mashed potatoes were good, but that is about it ..."
2967,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Over-rated in a town where you can get better buffet food at a much lower cost.
2968,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"He gave us a 30% discount on our food, but I don't think this was enough to want to return to this over-rated restaurant or recommend anyone to even waste their time going."
2969,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Bad location the garnish ruins the meal there's  no restrooms inside the restaurant 


Great music and fun environment  AMAZING BLOODY MARY'S BUT THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE SUCks bC OF THE LOCATION I would not go back"
2970,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,This however should have tipped me off to how mediocre this buffet was.
2971,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Worst buffet ever.
2972,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"No salmon, king crabs, or any of that stuff needed for a good buffet."
2973,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Overall, it wasn't worth it."
2974,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,So overall.. buffet at the Wynn and I don't really get along!
2975,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Its definitely not worth the wait, but the food is good average for Vegas buffets."
2976,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Overall, I'm glad I tried the Bellagio buffet but probably won't go back unless it's a dinner buffet."
2977,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Would never recommend this buffet for anyone especially at this price.
2978,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I've always had good experiences but this has been an Awful Thanksgiving!
2979,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,What a bunch of crooks...it is definitely not the same now that it is owned by MGM.
2980,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"If this is your first time in Vegas or won't be coming back in a while, then go with Paris, Wynn, or Wicked Spoon at Cosmopolitan instead."
2981,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Decent buffet but definitely can't compare to the size and offerings at Bacchanal and even Wicked Spoon.
2982,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"When I went in January, it wasn't memorable, and definitely not the place I've hyped up to some people."
2983,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I have not other buffets in LV to compare to as have stayed away for a reason; they show the worst of the worst human gluttony.
2984,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,We stood in line for over an hour to find a sub par buffet.
2985,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,A friend and I wanted to try the best buffet in Vegas and were underwhelmed.
2986,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,This is not a good  buffet.
2987,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Like many places in Vegas, they go a bit overboard on the technology, just because they can (ipads for cocktail menus, mobile device for payment, etc), which is ironic because it often makes the process more difficult."
2988,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,The worst buffet experience!
2989,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I can see how if they were on their game it could be really good.
2990,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,SO this is the place you go for dessert and that's about it.
2991,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Admittedly I am not a buffet fan and think they're disgusting for the most part.
2992,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"My fiancé and I had went to Wicked Spoon a few years and it was my favorite buffet in Vegas at the time, but it has gone downhill since then."
2993,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Probably not unless it was dinner.
2994,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Need food after the day club?
2995,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"For less $$ and far better food, the M resort kicks this buffet's A$$."
2996,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"In comparing the two, I prefer the Wicked Spoon because it had more variety and more food items I enjoyed."
2997,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I enjoyed the Rio a lot more and it's at a lower rate.
2998,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,No one wants to see your butt in a thong during a meal!
2999,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Please bring back the quality!
3000,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"This buffet used to be the first option when it opened last year, and back to that time, it provided better selections and more dedicated cuisines."
3001,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,So disappointed in the buffet last  night.
3002,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I am in awe how others rated this restaurant and no near a 4 stars - perhaps it's the portion size that's worth the 4 stars.
3003,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Don't think I would come back and give this place another try!!!
3004,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Sigh, the pitfalls of having high expectations."
3005,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,But I may have to share a plate in case I am disappointed again.
3006,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I have to say that I was extremely disappointed at the quality of the food, the layout of the buffet, and the overall experience."
3007,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Overall the ending of our experience was horrible, lacking in any customer service, and a disservice to the restaurant"
3008,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Original (four star) Review 11\/06:
All the reviews below that call this place ""the best Thai restaurant in the country"" are, frankly, doing this place a disservice."
3009,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"In my opinion, Gordon Ramsay's name overhypes the place and you can definitely find better burgers in Vegas."
3010,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I really really wanted to like this place but unfortunately, it got overhyped for me."
3011,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Other than that..this place is boring & even the food isn't the same.
3012,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Came here for Sunday Brunch and unfortunately I hate to say it but I wasn't impressed.
3013,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"From a visual standpoint, I somewhat expected a fancier buffet being that it was the Bellagio, but everything was pretty standard."
3014,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,We were here a few years ago so I can confidently say the quality has gone downhill.
3015,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"The first time I was willing to brush off as an off day; this past time, I was really put off, particularly since staying at the Wynn\/Encore lets you cut the line at this buffet, which is a huge draw."
3016,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Overall it was okay, not sure if I would come again."
3017,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,We will rather find new French cuisine experience in other places.
3018,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Honestly this place is overhyped.
3019,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"For the same price, Bellagio Buffet is a much better choice."
3020,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Even though I'm not much of a fan, you should still stop by and experience it for yourself :)"
3021,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Personally I'd head over to the Bellagio for a buffet, they cost a little less, and for some reason I still like the Bellagio buffet better."
3022,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"However, if you're more into quantity and quality, you should head to Bellagio."
3023,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,It was lack luster at best.
3024,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,:(  and it was one of the things I was REALLY looking forward to.
3025,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I remember the old days this buffet was unbelievably good.
3026,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"This three star rating is probably not really fair to this restaurant, BUT,  here is the reasoning."
3027,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,One word for the buffet is overrated.
3028,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I'm so sad that this place is now tainted by this experience.
3029,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,A French bistro would be not only a lot cheaper but also better!
3030,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Now you are just as bad as Planet Hollywood and the others sad places.
3031,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"With that being said, there are a limited number of things that make this place stand out."
3032,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"This is by far the most over-rated, over-hyped, over-priced buffet ever!"
3033,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Wasnt the greatest thing in the world.
3034,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I had other las vegas buffet for third of the price that was much better..... and no 40 minute wait in line.
3035,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,This is my first disappointing experience ever at The Earl.
3036,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Convenient place to dine at the Paris Hotel, however you are paying for the view..."
3037,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,My experience was soured by our first interaction with the management staff.
3038,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"All in all it was on OK experience, but I probably wouldn't go back there."
3039,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Having had multiple burgers from great places in Vegas - Burger Bar, Shake Shack, and even Holstein's during the same trip - Gordon Ramsay's BurGR didn't do the patty justice."
3040,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I wasn't too impressed for the $50 price I had to pay for the dinner buffet.
3041,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I hope they improve but at this time I cannot recommend the buffet anymore.
3042,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"However, $50 plus tax for just some good desserts, I'd rather spend extra to go to Bacchanal or spend much less at Rio which has more selection, fresher and more flavorful food with their basic buffet."
3043,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,The pasta didn't taste the same so my second visit was a bit disappointing especially after I paid $25 extra per person for not waiting for 4 hours.
3044,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Go to in n out or shake shack or even White Castle instead and congratulate yourself on a good decision.
3045,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Don't worry buffet managers, you won't have to deal with our kind EVER AGAIN!"
3046,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Probably a poor choice by me, a NY Italian to order that item even though expectations were at a minimum."
3047,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Either Gordon Ramsay's shows are a fake ass front or he needs to get over here to BurGR and get things in order the way he makes it appear on tv.
3048,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"The desserts are the best part and do leave a good last impression, but compared to the elite buffets of Vegas, Wicked Spoon doesn't have the quality, service, freshness, or variety to be considered 5-star."
3049,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I expected so much more from a buffet named ""one of the best in Las Vegas"" I have had the Wicked Spoon in the past."
3050,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,If you value yourself you don't want to eat here.
3051,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"It really doesn't matter much, because frankly, a buffet at the Wynn, ""entirely reimagined with over 120 new dishes"", charging $54 (holiday pricing), anything less than 4 stars is not worth going to."
3052,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"It was every bit of forty five minutes before our food came and guess what it took another twenty minute for my Hash Cobb salad to arrive, by that time I didn't want the salad I want to go our waiter never came over or nothing until I sent back the late salad."
3053,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,They changed a lot of the food stations for cheaper unappetizing dishes.
3054,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I really don't know what the hype is been here 3xs and each time it's just reg buffet food nothing special.
3055,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I would not return to Serendipty 3.
3056,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"We ALWAYS try our best to be good and friendly customers when we go out, but this was beyond disappointing."
3057,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"After all the hoopla about Gordon Ramsey, we decided to give this place a try - BIG MISTAKE !!!"
3058,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I had been to Bacchanal once for lunch and I thought it was just a tad above average for being one of the most touted buffets in Las Vegas.
3059,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Sorry hash house, Your Sahara location is always amazing, but as of now the Imperial palace location is way below par."
3060,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"So I had to call my card customer service explained what's going on-_-
Everyone knows fake sign is serious problem but only this restaurant doesn't know.."
3061,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I don't know if its because I have been a culinary arts major and I understand the marketing aspect of the restaurant, but its definitely a place where you are just paying for ""Gordon Ramsay"" name."
3062,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Don't waste your money on an easy Mac Alfredo pasta or a Las Vegas steak strip hard rock bread sandwich!
3063,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Such a classy hotel with great chefs but this buffet was horrible.
3064,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,There's too many other places with good food in my opinion.
3065,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,i probably won't go back on my next vegas visit.
3066,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,A lot of the dishes were empty and it just didn't live up to the hype for us.
3067,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Even though wicked spoon has gone down in quality it's still better than this place.
3068,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I am traumatized and am very skeptical about going to buffets now, especially in Vegas."
3069,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,You'll get the same breakfast quality at a Denny's or Chompies at a much better price.
3070,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Let me preface the following review by saying that if I didn't absolutely have a terrible experience, I wouldn't have said anything."
3071,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"My Mom and I were looking for a nice place to have dinner before a show, we sat outside and that was great, that's all that was great."
3072,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Hoping for something better next trip to the buffet.
3073,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Food isnt bad but just not worth the money and the experience.
3074,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I avoided the food I knew I could get at restaurants, like fried rice, pad thai and sushi."
3075,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,So many frustrating things with this buffet.
3076,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Billed as the best Thai in the country, I was surprised to find most of the food to be comparable to the good Thai places I eat at while at home."
3077,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,For quality of food I would still much rather have Wynn Buffet but this is not bad.
3078,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,My visit to this restaurant ruined my entire Las Vegas trip.
3079,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Overall, a good lunch, but ""good"" is not what I expected from the Bellagio."
3080,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,There are many more buffets and\/or restaurants on the strip that I would rather eat at.
3081,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"While The Buffet at the Wynn is one of the better ones in Vegas, it still suffers some of these inherent traits."
3082,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Save some money and go to the Rio and have the Carnival Buffet instead.
3083,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Then I taught myself how to make it and decided the rubbery squid and the average curries were not worth the trip to Commercial Center.
3084,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,We've had better meals at lower rated places.
3085,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"maybe a high expectation  you might think, but I think its a matter of the actual experience as a whole you have as well specially when you visit a well known\/highly rated restaurant."
3086,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Maybe this place is better left for desserts.
3087,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Would not recommend this place.
3088,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"It's a slap in the face to paying customers, especially people lured in by the Ramsay brand of making top notch food."
3089,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"And so, I shake my fist as I angrilly write this review."
3090,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"And as a person who adores Asian food, and being in Vegas, you can definitely expect the Asian food to be only of mediocre status, so sadly I wasn't impressed."
3091,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,The only good thing I can tell about this place - unlimited mimosas!
3092,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Perhaps it is 4 and 5 star place by Vegas standard, but there is absolutely nothing special about this sandwich place."
3093,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I will never come to this buffet for sure.
3094,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"So, naturally, I was a bit nervous to return as I had relived the ecstasy in that meal over and over in my head and was fearful a second return trip would not deliver in the same fashion."
3095,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Corral has much better food and service.
3096,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,the magic of this buffet is long gone and it is just average at best.
3097,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Overall, I would rather have one nice meal, than so-so foods at this price."
3098,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"So I am not the type of person to ever write a bad review, but this was much needed."
3099,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,It seems like they tried to get a little too cute with the offerings.
3100,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Will never come back again, we rather go to the restaurant over at The Venetian the best service and the foods is excellent , grand Lux Cafe is the bomb."
3101,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,A dish that can be easily made at home shouldn't be $13 and most certainly shouldn't be served in a gordon ramsay restaurant.
3102,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I've been brokenhearted by a buffet again.
3103,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"A note on comparison to SEA (another of our reviews):  Lotus is better, if you will take the short drive to it (and look beyond the scary strip mall it's in)."
3104,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"And that was the problem across the board, everything was just average."
3105,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Don't get me wrong the Sandwiches here are alright but after seeing all of the rave reviews and 4.5 star overall rating I really do feel let down and expected way better than I got especially when they claim to be home of ""The worlds greatest hot Sandwich""."
3106,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Overall, it was a cute place, but that's pretty much it for me."
3107,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I'm thinking maybe it was the time of day I went but I don't think I would pay for dinner price.
3108,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,There has been a definite decline at The Buffet and you can definitely notice that in the lines.
3109,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Given the price, and the average 30 minutes of wait just for food to arrive, I would NOT recommend this place."
3110,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,We are done with buffet for good!
3111,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I was a little disappointed that the second time around was pretty much all the same food for dinner.
3112,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Everything was a hit or miss and there were a lot of misses.
3113,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I most likely would not go back due to the large crowds and I am not someone who can eat multiple plates of food.
3114,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,There are a ton of buffets in Vegas and I will not be eating at this place again.
3115,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"In our opinion, Bacchanal is better."
3116,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Disappointed because I really like Chef Ramsey

As a suggestion, they should really change the girls uniforms!"
3117,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Ok this place leaves a lot to be desired.
3118,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I didn't recommend this place.
3119,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I hope they were just having a BAD day and I'll give it another chance because I do like the Bacchanal Buffet, but this past Sunday's exeperience left me LACKLUSTER."
3120,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Buffets are places you get bland average food at prices low enough to justify eating bland average food, right?"
3121,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Not a good idea... there were a line of guys for the mens restroom for two stalls... and you can only imagine how you won't have much of an appetite afterwards.
3122,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I would not bother going again.
3123,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I prefer the excalibur buffet which has the same stuff and more kid friendly food for half the price.
3124,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Before I thought it was worth it since the service was better and the food better than now.
3125,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"We ate at Cravings and Bellagio had more in terms of selection, comfort, quality and service."
3126,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"The portions of plated food are all going to be smaller naturally, but that's what makes this place annoying."
3127,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,By far one of the most stunning on the strip but the buffet just falls flat compared to others in the area.
3128,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Then I realized I had missed the lamb.
3129,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I consider this highway robbery, and will not be spending my dollars at Caesars again!"
3130,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Overall, it's a GOOD burger but I don't think it's worth the hassle."
3131,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,No consideration how much money people paid for this trashy experience.
3132,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Some specific mentions: Don't waste your time with the sushi, don't go anywhere near the Chinese food, and if you're tempted by the meat station, prepare to look like some sort of a savage trying to grab some meat off the bones."
3133,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Sugar factory in the Mirage is way better and there are several other locations on the strip that I am sure would be far superior.
3134,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"The menu is fairly small with maybe a dozen burgers, (some chicken, fish, and vegetarian options available), a few hot dogs, some appetizers, a handful of salads and a smattering of milkshakes."
3135,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Better than Subway and Quiznos, but it's nothing out of the ordinary."
3136,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"After a couple of times here, however, I'm not entirely sure why people bow down to this place."
3137,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Another place over rated but mediocre.
3138,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"The staff argued that it was in fact well done, we were already miffed about the shake so we didn't argue, just vowed to write this review and never come to this place again."
3139,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Overall, I'd give this place 5 stars for friendly service and amazingly large and creative portions, but only 3 stars on taste that doesn't match presentation."
3140,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I was very disappointed since food was as good as before.
3141,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"However, I didn't love it and I will not dream about going back to it."
3142,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,My daughter made better ones when she was 10.
3143,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Our local Thai restaurant beats this hands down.
3144,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I was really looking forward to the Wicked Spoon but unfortunately with the experience we had, it just didn't happen."
3145,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Not a bad experience, but not one I will likely repeat."
3146,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I guess you're supposed to be a fan of his, and be glad just to be in his restaurant."
3147,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,And the crappiest buffet food for $597.11 for 12!
3148,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"What topped off this dismal buffet was our dismal server, not one soda refill and he was nowhere in sight all evening."
3149,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"We were sad to miss out on top shelf margaritas, but refused to pay $12 at a $44 buffet."
3150,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Some things I probably would have loved were the antipasto meats and cheeses, and the tacos, but alas, I was forced to stick to soup and salad for the most part."
3151,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,If you really want a great place drive down to the M Resort.
3152,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"So if you want more, you have to walk several times, or some just took the sushi and dumped it onto a big plate and left a stack of small sushi plates at the buffet."
3153,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I don't see myself returning to this buffet any time soon.
3154,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I can't comment as to what other dishes I've had there, as I'm not very familiar with thai food."
3155,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,This was our only poor experience.
3156,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,That was the only good thing.
3157,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,This is my first bad experience in Wynn hotel.
3158,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"""you expect me to PAY for this after the way I was treated?!"""
3159,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I was so let down that I just left, and before writing this review, just to give them a fair shot at redemption I called to try to speak with someone at the buffet."
3160,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,So went to Vegas oh we could go for a Bashlor party and I got everyone hyped up to go to the Bellagio buffet where I heard it was one of the best buffets rated in the world and I was really excited to go so we went out to Vegas did our Vegas thing and got everyone to go eat at the  buffet and as an avid buffet go or I would give this only three stars they had really good food but from the hype that I've heard and only having four options for sushi I was disappointed for a $50 buffet so if you want your bang for the buck explore explore explore is plenty of awesome places to eat in Vegas and this is the place I will never go to again
3161,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"If we would have been at the Aria Buffet, those things would have been taken care of on the spot."
3162,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Last time I was in Vegas we ate at the Lakeside in the Wynn and I would recommend it over this place for a truly special adult night on the town.
3163,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,It's all wasteful.
3164,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,The only downfall with this restaurant is that the seating is very over crowded.
3165,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Yes, it was fun with all the different food booth but my low rating is all about experience."
3166,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"We got full,but will try another buffet next time."
3167,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,All of the meats I tried were simply seasoned and had low percentage of having been effed up.
3168,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Not a good impression since they set the tone.
3169,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"The lady down the street raved about this place....so to be fair I would need to go back and try other things, but my overall experience was not fulfilling."
3170,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,But those days are no more--and they have gone been since the crash of the economy in 2008--this Buffet has never come back.
3171,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Maybe we'll go back and order food next time, but there are so many better, more unique, restaurants to choose from."
3172,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,What a waste of money and time.
3173,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I was so excited for this authentic Thai restaurant and was sorely disappointed.
3174,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I realize this is a buffet, but this should've been my que to run for the door!"
3175,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"9 days later, I finally was able to eat normal food again."
3176,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"This place is way too over hyped, and was really the only crappy thing about my recent Vegas trip."
3177,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I bragged about you for years to my man only to be sorely disappointed when we finally made it.
3178,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,It was the letdown of our trip.
3179,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Unlike other buffets that don't do this, I would say go there instead of here."
3180,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,My bf has a gluten allergy and asked the server for a recommendation.
3181,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"We waited 45 minutes to be called, and with the name attached to the restaurant I would expect much much more."
3182,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,This buffet is a joke.
3183,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,The Wynn is as good as it gets when it comes to dinner buffets on the strip.
3184,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,You're paying nearly double for the Ramsey brand for the same tasting food you could get elsewhere or cook at home.
3185,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"So disappointed... Every yelp search for 24 hour food totally sent me towards the Earl, and when I needed them the absolute most (right now)..."
3186,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"THE FOOD: 
On average, the food was good, not great and there is nothing I would go back for."
3187,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Okay the first time I tried this place, I wasn't impressed and I was kind of disappointed because I've heard so much hoop-la about this place."
3188,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,For a Wynn hotel to charge and serve overprice mediocre buffet is unacceptable.
3189,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"nope, very disappointed the wicked spoon is much better and a lot cheaper than the buffet here, sorry guys its the price that makes you want to like this place and not the food."
3190,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"2010 - Hash House a go-go opens a second Las Vegas location, this time in the Imperial Palace."
3191,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Price: At about $35 a person, its very expensive when you consider the quality of the meal

Overall: My advice is beware, it may not be as good as everyone touts it to be."
3192,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,This place was a bit overrated and hyped.
3193,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I used to tell people it was the best buffet on the Vegas Strip, but I am no longer a fan."
3194,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"After we were seated you can order water, tea, fountain drinks."
3195,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I am thoroughly heartbroken about my experience here...Our bill came to about $200...um I think I've eaten a better meal at the outback!
3196,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I personally had higher expectations for the buffet that is rated as the best that Las Vegas has to offer.
3197,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,However you're probably better off saving money and your stomach at a food stall open around.
3198,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Overall, from the other extravagant buffet offerings around, I can't say that the Bellagio's buffet tops out the list of best buffet in Vegas."
3199,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,We went here last trip and we weren't impressed.
3200,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,If this is the best buffet on the strip the other's must be totally awful.
3201,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"We ordered Smoke salmon egg Benedict, blueberry pancakes and cheese omelet, everything was OK but not what I was expecting from a 4k reviews, 4 stars restaurant."
3202,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Save your money and go to the buffet at the M resort.
3203,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I wish I had gone to different restaurant I could have better dish for $50 instead of disappointment
3204,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"In summary, novel concept, expensive for what you get, food choices limited compared to other Vegas fine buffets, and fairly long wait time."
3205,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Not too long ago, it was one of those hidden finds off the touristy Las Vegas Strip."
3206,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"When comparing to Wicked Spoon in terms of price, food, and service, I would choose Wicked Spoon every time."
3207,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"For all the hype and recommendations I got about this place, I expected better."
3208,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Everything else about the Wynn\/Encore is great, somehow they neglected the buffet."
3209,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,We can't all be winners.
3210,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"So on a whole this night was just so bad I had to write a review, I think I would have been happier with In-N-Out!"
3211,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,SERIOUSLY take your money to a nice restaurant and get yourself a high quality or steak or something.
3212,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I don't understand why everyone is so positive about this buffet.
3213,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,The ice cream between layers nothing special and overall dessert that waiter pushed hard felt let down.
3214,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Woukd have been better served at a cheap buffet.
3215,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Their system is completely messed up and this was very disappointing during our stay in Vegas during Christmas as we were really looking forward to eating here for Christmas dinner...
3216,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Didn't think he could disappoint us, but this restaurant is a for sure MISS."
3217,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Not quite the M Buffet but still a really good buffet!
3218,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"It could possible that Wicked Spoon was overhyped, because I do not eat meat or went during a weekday lunch...but overall, I thought this buffet wasn't that impressive."
3219,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,(3) The only bathroom was outside the entrance and woefully undersized for a buffet that seats hundreds of people.
3220,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Quantity and quality was below expectations for a $55 meal.
3221,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Not a bad brunch for $35... but once is probably enough.
3222,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,There are better and cheaper options in Vegas!
3223,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,The best thing about Wicked Spoon Buffet's offerings is their dessert but that doesn't make up for everything else that they lack.
3224,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Dessert is the only highlight.
3225,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Probably will not try it again unless a group of friends force me to go.
3226,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"But for being one of the highest-rated buffets in Vegas, it really wasn't THAT impressive."
3227,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,We also had a male server who took our actual food order.
3228,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,This buffet was supposed to be one of the highlights of my trip and it turned out to be okay.
3229,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Conclusion: if you've had good NY food don't waste your money here for decent red meat and desert bc you could obviously do that at a steak restaurant or other place.
3230,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"I will not be ever going back there, there are better buffets for  locals in Vegas."
3231,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,There was only a couple people in the restaurant on a Tuesday and they were being this rude!
3232,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,The price is a little steep for the quality of food there though.
3233,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"The Las Vegas version of Serendipity 3 is like a movie sequel, one that disappoints rather than continues your love for the original."
3234,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I would not come back here nor recommend this buffet.
3235,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,If you want to look over the lunch menu or bye .. Basically told us to leave ...
3236,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,There are many other buffets in Vegas that are better for the same price.
3237,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Considering that Gourmet magazine said it was the best Thai restaurant in North America, AND that Frommers highly recommended it, I expected a lot more."
3238,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,Save your time and money.
3239,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Unfortunately, today we had a poor experience."
3240,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"The dessert section was superior to Bellagio's, but cmon we did not pay $46 a person to feast on desserts."
3241,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"only good thing about this place unfortunately is that it's in a beautiful hotel, but needless to say that they need to redo the buffet menu"
3242,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I have been coming to this buffet for over 10 years and it used to be one of my faves.
3243,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Why pay such high prices for other fancy places when this place is affordable, brand name, and all around delicious?"
3244,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Their wine list is nice, the dessert menu is tempting."
3245,FOOD#POSITIVE,"It had asian food, seafood, different meats, a dessert bar as big as the sushi bar, and a salad bar to top it off."
3246,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Very good surprise
With this buffet
Very various and nice food
Even for the breakfast every food including the deserts are present
I hardly recommend 
Can easily be compared to the wynn buffet"
3247,FOOD#POSITIVE,Good place for breakfast if you are staying at Caesars.
3248,FOOD#POSITIVE,I doubt you can say there isn't something for you in this buffet.
3249,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I got a basic breakfast and the eggs were done very well, the potatoes tasted great, and the bacon was pretty good."
3250,FOOD#POSITIVE,Overall the food was excellent and the deserts was just fabulous!
3251,FOOD#POSITIVE,Each time I had a different sandwich or wrap and I loved everything!
3252,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Food quality is better than average (best in Vegas), but service is horrible."
3253,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Food, service, almost everything was great!"
3254,FOOD#POSITIVE,2: good food variety.
3255,FOOD#POSITIVE,another great experience here... yummy bloody mary... good crusty bread and real butter...
3256,FOOD#POSITIVE,"One of Lotus of Siam's signature dishes, which I'd never had anywhere else, was the garlic prawn."
3257,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They serve Asian, Mexican, American and Italian food."
3258,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Unfortunately I'm that person that goes to a buffet and gets full from looking at all the food, yet somehow I still always want to go."
3259,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The sandwiches were decent enough size to give you a comfortable ""full"" feel after a sandwich and a half."
3260,FOOD#POSITIVE,Its another great place to eat delicious food.
3261,FOOD#POSITIVE,I had the spinach omelet with goat cheese... Yummy
3262,FOOD#POSITIVE,"However, this time around, I think there were more options and a wide range of different ethnic foods."
3263,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The wine list is good, and it helps when they waiters are in the know about what they are selling."
3264,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I tried the Gordon burger which has a pork patty, duck bacon, avocado, and other tasty things I can't remember."
3265,FOOD#POSITIVE,The quality of the food is better than some restaurants.
3266,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Food was just good and worth the experience of ""go big or go home"" I personally wouldn't come back here for food but it's deff a place to check out."
3267,FOOD#POSITIVE,So good with the fresh bread they give you.
3268,FOOD#POSITIVE,The wine list is a tome.
3269,FOOD#POSITIVE,Love the presentation in the shot glasses.
3270,FOOD#POSITIVE,"A wide selection of food from Asian, fresh seafood, Italian, etc."
3271,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The Thai Beef Salad was refreshing and had a cute presentation, must of been the coconut half that served as a garnish."
3272,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Not only are the portions big, bordering on glutenous, but the food is outstanding."
3273,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Very reasonably priced for Vegas and the portions are rather large, someone told me to split the portions, but my lady and I are tough, we can handle it!"
3274,FOOD#POSITIVE,Desserts... lots to choose from.
3275,FOOD#POSITIVE,"All the food was to die for and if you are a burger enthusiast like I am... you probably wouldn't want to have another burger ever, unless it was from here!"
3276,FOOD#POSITIVE,The way they give out small individual portions was definitely impressive.
3277,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Other than that, pretty good food and great atmosphere."
3278,FOOD#POSITIVE,There's a huge choice of hot and cold food and the desert is fantastic.
3279,FOOD#POSITIVE,Great food in center of Strip!
3280,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Food was great especially the chicken sliders...the price point as well as the service was perfect, strongly recommended"
3281,FOOD#POSITIVE,This has to be one of the best sandwich places around!
3282,FOOD#POSITIVE,Good choice of sandwiches and salads for a decent price.
3283,FOOD#POSITIVE,"But we hit the road right after (not smart, as we all got struck with massive food coma after our meal here), so unfortunately a lot went to waste :(

My friend and I shared the chicken and waffles."
3284,FOOD#POSITIVE,The options at your average buffet are overwhelming to me and I find no pleasure in the variety of food mixing on my plate.
3285,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Pros:
Wow, the food, truly the best Thai food in North America."

3287,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The best part, for me, since I am a fatty, is the dessert bar."
3288,FOOD#POSITIVE,"While the food was delicious,  I can't give Burgr a great review because my water glass was broken and the glass cut my thumb."
3289,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Ordered many dishes, everything we ordered was excellent."
3290,FOOD#POSITIVE,"With these little skillets and baskets and bowls for each person, you can ensure you are getting the food it was meant to be served."

3292,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Tons of options, everything was very good."
3293,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Everything was cooked just right and, despite a full restaurant, delivered promptly."
3294,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There's a fantastic crepe station, and gelato also."
3295,FOOD#POSITIVE,My family and I love Bellagio buffet because they have a variety of food and we've always gotten good service from them.
3296,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Is it cool getting brisket, crab legs, macarons, and fried chicken at the same meal?"
3297,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food, service, and atmosphere were great and the prices were very reasonable for a restaurant right on the strip."
3298,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food is great , large portions at reasonable prices."
3299,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There are several ""must have"" dishes at Wicked Spoon:  the French Toast was almost as good as homemade French toast that is left to marinate to sogginess in egg; the Eggs Benedict were fantastic--as good as a la carte at any brunch place."
3300,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Now the food, OHHHH the food....this restaurant has by far the best selection."
3301,FOOD#POSITIVE,I got the Italian and it was simply good.
3302,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Foodwise, I enjoyed the crab legs (you could get warm), and there were different kinds of roasted meats!"

3304,FOOD#POSITIVE,"As I have frequently dined at the Mon Ami Gabi in Bethesda, Maryland, I pretty much knew what to expect - good food and service."

3306,FOOD#POSITIVE,This is the best burger and fries I have ever had!
3307,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Don't get me wrong..really great menue, good service..just not EXCELLENT."
3308,FOOD#POSITIVE,And there's so much of it.
3309,FOOD#POSITIVE,In addition to that... the food was tremendous!
3310,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Don't get me wrong, this place has great food, but I think I just chose their worse dish they have to offer, which is why I knocked off two stars."
3311,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Pastas, salads, chicken, steak, prime rib, veggies, steamed clams, mussels, sushi, soup,  BBQ ribs, pizza, sausage... (just to name the most random dishes I could recall at the top of my head) Even the pickiest of eaters could find and fill up on something they enjoy."
3312,FOOD#POSITIVE,I like the omelette station and the Asian area.
3313,FOOD#POSITIVE,I ate 3 of them.... and OMG they have coffee flavored Mochi Creams... that are JUST as good as the ones you pay $2.25 each for at Mitsuwa Market...
3314,FOOD#POSITIVE,His name is done justice as the Masterchef and Hell's Kitchen celebrity chef leaves no flaw in his burgers or his truffle fries.

3320,FOOD#POSITIVE,"And, the shakes were also sooooo nice."
3321,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Best buffet on the strip hands down.. prime rib, crab legs, cornish game hen,and their small desserts are amazing."
3322,FOOD#POSITIVE,I felt the Rio Carnival buffet was one of the best in town due to their quantity over quality approach.
3323,FOOD#POSITIVE,"A Thai dish with Burmese influence; one of the chef's recommended dishes, and for good reason."
3324,FOOD#POSITIVE,I have to say the portions are HUGE but the meal is overall bland for my taste and always arriving luke warm\/room temp.
3325,FOOD#POSITIVE,I was impressed with not only the variety here but the little things they did to spruce up otherwise ordinary dishes.
3326,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Next up was the Euro Burger, which had a very nice truffle aioli, with additions of arugula, goat cheese, and oven roasted tomatoes."
3327,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The variety is amazing, we manages to catch lunch and dinner, everything we were able to try before becoming sickly full was ridiculously good."
3328,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I have been here a few times and I like the convenience of ordering the food to go, especially if you are staying at Planet Hollywood."
3329,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food excellent, the service awesome, and location ?"
3330,FOOD#POSITIVE,"If you want to binge eat after a long drunken night of losing, this might be your spot!"
3331,FOOD#POSITIVE,One of my favorites was the Chocolate & Heath Bar covered strawberries and Gelato on the the dessert bar.
3332,FOOD#POSITIVE,"We went up for a second round, came back to the table 10-15 minutes later (yes, buffet is that extensive) all the dirty dishes glasses, etc were right where we left them."
3333,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Top of the line Alaskan Crab legs, all sorts of meat, i.e., Kobe, Elk, Ostrich, etc."
3334,FOOD#POSITIVE,The Asian section in general was very good.
3335,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Being it that most people go to buffets to try a lot of different kinds of foods, I was excited about a buffet that would cater to that."
3336,FOOD#POSITIVE,"However, the other seafood offerings (cold and hot) were pretty excellent and the dessert section was definitely worth saving room for."
3337,FOOD#POSITIVE,They had a great selection of items however not all items were as tasty as they looked.
3338,FOOD#POSITIVE,The best Thai food with excellent service in the entire country period.
3339,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There was a massive food selection to pick from, ranging from sushi to gelato to pasta."
3340,FOOD#POSITIVE,Great value for a hot toasted sandwich!
3341,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Good price, huge array of food choices, delicious, meticulously prepared plates."
3342,FOOD#POSITIVE,I did like the idea of the specialty items are in small portions which is a good thing.
3343,FOOD#POSITIVE,They had a vast selection of foods from every ethnicity in a food court at fine dining quality.
3344,FOOD#POSITIVE,I am totally craving their Euro Burger!
3345,FOOD#POSITIVE,"You can enjoy lot of ethnic foods, from Chinese to Indian, as befits a hotel that draws visitors from all over the globe."
3346,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Flavorful, quality, and a great variety of choices for every palate and or dietary restriction."
3347,FOOD#POSITIVE,"It is the only buffet in Vegas that has an Asian food section serving up ramen, pho, hot and sour soup, wonton soup, miso soup, BBQ pork, roast pork, roast duck, AND pork soup dumplings (xiao long baos), to accompany a wide selection of dim sum and sushi edibles."
3348,FOOD#POSITIVE,Not a big buffet person but I thought for the price  the selection was pretty good.
3349,FOOD#POSITIVE,Great food.
3350,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I came back to the table with 3 plates of dessert, 'nuff said."
3351,FOOD#POSITIVE,"We expected lamb chops and prime rib but not the Mexican pozole, taco station and the chile verde which were all excellent."
3352,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They had everything from Asian to Italian cuisine, diner style dishes to seafood delights and everything in between with a massive dessert station, of course."
3353,FOOD#POSITIVE,"This could be good or bad for you, but I like having a ton of choices."
3354,FOOD#POSITIVE,They advertise to have 500 items for lunch buffets but I am sure they were much less.
3355,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Very tasty
This restaurant is also halal friendly to those Muslims out there (beef only)."
3356,FOOD#POSITIVE,The sandwich is not that big but definitely packs in a ton of flavor.
3357,FOOD#POSITIVE,I've never seen such a vast selection of items from the breakfasts to the dessert station.
3358,FOOD#POSITIVE,Lots of vegetarian options.
3359,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Some dishes that stick out in my mind:

Soups: I've had a few different soups, but they've all been really good."
3360,FOOD#POSITIVE,"At the end of the day food was great, service was sub-par Gordon should have been there lighting a fire under their Ass!"
3361,FOOD#POSITIVE,The whole meal should have been free since it was mostly still on the table because we didn't want to eat it.
3362,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food was quite good but for the price I would expect better service.
3363,FOOD#POSITIVE,"A few of the things i just saw at the brunch..Crab legs, lobster, caviar, oysters, a full REAL sushi bar, 5 kinds of sausage, 5 kinds of eggs, omlettes , pizza, sandwiches, asian food that looks real, several kinds of potstickers and sticky buns, a full mexican food section, and an unbelievable amount of dessert."
3364,FOOD#POSITIVE,Excellent service and food and the decor...beautiful.
3365,FOOD#POSITIVE,4+ different flavors of Macarons?
3366,FOOD#POSITIVE,The desserts here are also a highlight as they have their own gelato area which has over 10 flavors.
3367,FOOD#POSITIVE,Large buffet selection however I really can't say it's worth the $50 (includes mandatory tip).
3368,FOOD#POSITIVE,Don't forget to order the Earl Gray Lemonade.
3369,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Nice place
Take a very long time to be seated because its so busy there, but its worth the wait in vegas price is decent plus so much food you can take back to your room for the next day..."
3370,FOOD#POSITIVE,Lots of desserts.
3371,FOOD#POSITIVE,"We went for breakfast today (March 11) and were impressed by the vast selection of Asian, European, and traditional American cuisine."
3372,FOOD#POSITIVE,A large variety of breakfast items.
3373,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Food: 5\/5
Location: 5\/5
Ambiance: 5\/5
Service: 4\/5
Experience: 5\/5


The Verdict: 5\/5

I normally don't give 5\/5 but this buffet does deserve this score."
3374,FOOD#POSITIVE,But that's not to say they don't have a vast selection of different foods.
3375,FOOD#POSITIVE,"the food selection was fantastic, but waiting over hour to be seated."
3376,FOOD#POSITIVE,"(Kao soi kai,beef pad see ew,beef pad thai, shrimp drunken noodle,red curry,yellow curry,beef penang) you should try it so you know what is the real authentic food!"
3377,FOOD#POSITIVE,The chicken and waffle is as good as the rest of these yelp reviews say and so are the huge portions!
3378,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They also have a pretty substantial wine list, and about two dozen wines by the glass."
3379,FOOD#POSITIVE,Their pho station was decent.
3380,FOOD#POSITIVE,"A little pricy at 50.00 a head,  but fresh with great selection."

3390,FOOD#POSITIVE,The dessert selection and quality is very good and we enjoyed that part of the meal.
3391,FOOD#POSITIVE,The croutons were so good that we got a side order of them.
3392,FOOD#POSITIVE,Overall tons of options of general good quality.
3393,FOOD#POSITIVE,It's like drinking blue cotton candy (warning - it is STRONG if you're a lightweight - I had two and I should have kept it to one).
3394,FOOD#POSITIVE,"With more than 500+ dishes to choose from daily, every guest is sure to satiate their immense craving at Bacchanal, whether it's one for prime rib, chilled king crab legs that are already cut for you, grilled lamb chop, made to order tacos, and baked-to-order pastries."
3395,FOOD#POSITIVE,"escargot was good too, don't forget to dip bread in the sauce :)

3396,FOOD#POSITIVE,hands down best sandwich ive ever had.
3397,FOOD#POSITIVE,Pretty large selection of food.

3399,FOOD#POSITIVE,The selections and quality was delicious and amazing as we saw in Las Vegas.
3400,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food is good but I prefer more selection at my buffets especially because I'm a picky eater who doesn't eat pork, red meat, or seafood."
3401,FOOD#POSITIVE,The prime rib was also good and there was great service.
3402,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Staff was friendly and a delish, hearty, breakfast to start the day."
3403,FOOD#POSITIVE,"That's not the bad part of the experience, the food was great but they were not the best."
3404,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Unfortunately I don't really have much to compare it to in terms of Vegas buffets, but there was definitely a lot of selection, and a lot of food."
3405,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Aside from the sushi, there's a salad station, Asian station, pizza station, carving station (prime rib for lunch, beef Wellington for dinner - my boyfriend's favorite), and a variety of seafood (including a station for shrimp cocktail and crabs), among others."
3406,FOOD#POSITIVE,We ate family style and every dish was amazing.
3407,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food here is bomb!!
3408,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Prime rib was great, the various Asian selections were a highlight, and the dessert bar is enormous."
3409,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Your soft drinks and juices are included then they also have all you can drink mimosa, beer (miller light or newcastle), or wine (choose one for $22 and you get to keep the caesars engraved glass)

My favorite menu items: 

the shrimp was awesome, with cocktail sauce, lemon, and real horseradish."
3410,FOOD#POSITIVE,Glad I had a chance to eat here last year.
3411,FOOD#POSITIVE,There is a station for pretty much any interest.
3412,FOOD#POSITIVE,"So if you're looking for some delicious food at a good price, Hash House is where you'll find it."
3413,FOOD#POSITIVE,This place is slightly spendy ($40 for the both of us) but the food was amazing.
3414,FOOD#POSITIVE,"This does perhaps limit the space on your plate, but at least your foods won't be ""bleeding"" into each other."
3415,FOOD#POSITIVE,"From the taste to the presentation, this is a foodie's heaven."
3416,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They also have some more original offerings, but to be honest after spending more than an hour there I couldn't really remember anything I had eaten."
3417,FOOD#POSITIVE,Seafood from the raw bar is fresh and they have something like stew fish.
3418,FOOD#POSITIVE,"First off, the portions are HUGE!!!"
3419,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Afterwards, I went to the dessert section and it looked amazing, but didn't taste that amazing."
3420,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They have some interesting offerings, like a make-your-own oxtail pho station, gelato, and tacos to order."
3421,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Love the food, great service
I miss the hash though."
3422,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Pros were the beef ribs (fresh cut at the Prime Rib station), and actually, the mushroom polenta (though admittedly, I'm a sucker for mushroom dishes)."
3423,FOOD#POSITIVE,Even though I barely had room - I had to get some sweets.
3424,FOOD#POSITIVE,Best thai food!
3425,FOOD#POSITIVE,I had no room for dessert after gorging myself on so much food.
3426,FOOD#POSITIVE,There was a wide selection of food items at the buffet but it was all pretty mediocre.
3427,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Solid burger joint, but nothing to wait in line for."

3432,FOOD#POSITIVE,Love love the food!!!!!

3438,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The good thing is they have shrimp cocktail, ribs, brisket, steak, a large selection of desserts, etc."
3439,FOOD#POSITIVE,It's cheap and great food!
3440,FOOD#POSITIVE,Both of us had the holiday turkey sandwich (which was very good!).

3442,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Again, the sandwich is huge."
3443,FOOD#POSITIVE,There is so much selection and my party and I LOVE seafood.

3447,FOOD#POSITIVE,They looked so good and really none were good at all.
3448,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I have never been too much a fan of this dish, but this was very good and I would have to say the best version of it I have ever had."
3449,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Although the menu was creative and fun, the execution could use a little help."
3450,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They had creme brulee which is my favorite, sorbets, candy, cookies, and your typical desserts, but on another level."
3451,FOOD#POSITIVE,If you like massive portions and salt less\/flavorless food at a affordable price this is this place for you.
3452,FOOD#POSITIVE,- Presentation: 4.5\/5 More than we expected.
3453,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The orange chicken is also very good, especially paired with the fried rice."
3454,FOOD#POSITIVE,They even had very tasty tiny bite size cheeseburgers.
3455,FOOD#POSITIVE,"As with many buffets, the food run the gambit from classic American fare like your mini burgers, fries and mac & cheese, to Mexican, to Chinese, and again, everything worked quite well."
3456,FOOD#POSITIVE,The portions were in small containers which meant you didn't overeat which I really appreciated.
3457,FOOD#POSITIVE,Thank you to Chef Saipan Chutima for coming to Las Vegas to share such soulful food with our city's growing culture.
3458,FOOD#POSITIVE,The place is good with beautiful waitresses and the food is amazing!

3468,FOOD#POSITIVE,Most of the food was average to good.

3470,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food, staff, and atmosphere are unmatched anywhere in Vegas and truly reminded me of being in Paris FR."
3471,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The dessert station was big, but didn't seem as good as I expected."
3472,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There were some pretty standard items like benedicts, piles of bacon, omelets, and random assorted pastries and breads, as well as an Asian station, meat station, and Italian and New American stations."
3473,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They also had a jook bar, which was a bit bland but unique for a Vegas buffet."
3474,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food was good and very big portions.
3475,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Bread pudding, I do love my bread pudding, and this place does a kickass job especially for a buffet."
3476,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I did eat a lot more than I usually do kinda like thanksgiving, but I enjoyed every single bite of it."
3477,FOOD#POSITIVE,* The dessert section was colorful and especially love the sorbet offerings.
3478,FOOD#POSITIVE,"For me, it will be a once only visit but it does offer a large range of options, especially if you have fussy eaters in your group & a restaurant selection is difficult."
3479,FOOD#POSITIVE,Damn the food was amazing.
3480,FOOD#POSITIVE,We didn't get starters but the choices looked delicious.
3481,FOOD#POSITIVE,The choice of 12 Gelato is also a fantastic finish to the meal.
3482,FOOD#POSITIVE,"If you like international foods, Wynn buffet is for you."
3483,FOOD#POSITIVE,"As a fan, I had recently eaten at GR Steak, which was an amazing experience, but again as a fan I felt compelled to eat at burgr and probably shouldn't have, leaving my GR food experience as super positive."
3484,FOOD#POSITIVE,"All in all, the presentation of mini offerings was nice, but nothing tasted spectacular enough for me to come back."
3485,FOOD#POSITIVE,The quality of the cuisine is phenomenal.
3486,FOOD#POSITIVE,I only had enough room in the belly for 6 options  =(  Love that they have gelato too - one of each flavor please!
3487,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food is not exceptional but it was ok. Not your typical pig trough buffet, the presentation was excellent overall."
3488,FOOD#POSITIVE,For me this was the best one in terms of food quality and flavor.
3489,FOOD#POSITIVE,The major cuisines are well represented.
3490,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The gelato was outstanding, however."
3491,FOOD#POSITIVE,I came here for lunch and liked that they had a lot of the dishes they had to offer.
3492,FOOD#POSITIVE,Food was OK wine list was above average.
3493,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Loved the cheesecakes and mochi ice cream (green tea especially)

Bottom line, check was like $200 almost with a bottle of wine (not the best I've tasted but I didn't order it)."
3494,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Nonetheless, the buffet offered a lot of high quality food."
3495,FOOD#POSITIVE,We were very impressed with this presentation and preparation.
3496,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Wonderful wine list (lots of german whites, a perfect foil for spicy Thai cuisine), great service, pleasant atmosphere."
3497,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Some notable offerings were prime rib, kobe sirloin, chilled king crab legs, and beef wellington."
3498,FOOD#POSITIVE,"So if you order carefully and not on the outer limits of cuisine (you know, plain and simple, don't get creative), you'll get a good, maybe even a great, late-night meal."
3499,FOOD#POSITIVE,"On a side note, the eye candy is splendid lol 

The food:

Onion Soup Au Gratin- I really liked their onion soup, it is one of their most popular items and it should be ordered."
3500,FOOD#POSITIVE,You get about 8 pieces of beef that comes with a dipping sauce.
3501,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The buffet at Bellagio had the selection but lacked flavors in most dishes, the lighting was dark and gloomy, the ambiance was dated, and the service...omg the service was horrible."
3502,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Many other buffets are either cheaper or offer more choices, but the price you pay for the taste and quality of food at The Buffet at Bellagio, you can't get any better than that."
3503,FOOD#POSITIVE,I liked the balance of food here.
3504,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They also have a lot of Northern (Burmese) dishes, which are rarely found in Thai restauarants."
3505,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food alone is worth 4 stars but Alex with the glasses made me give 5 stars!
3506,FOOD#POSITIVE,the hella kitchen and Chanterelle burgers were the best ever.
3507,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Good quality omelettes, strong coffee, everything under control."
3508,FOOD#POSITIVE,"In addition, it offers a variety of fruit cups, parfaits, potato salads, cookies, chips and the like."
3509,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I tried the eggs benedict which were good, as well as items from the carving station."
3510,FOOD#POSITIVE,One of the top 5 sandwiches of my life.
3511,FOOD#POSITIVE,3) for the choice of variety its great but it wasn't memorable.
3512,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The carvers had a selection if prime rib, slabs of bacon and turkey."
3513,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I mean AYCE and the mixture was perfect between the sauce and the seaweed itself, and it was refreshing with the roast turkey that was being served."
3514,FOOD#POSITIVE,We started by ordering an off dry riesling since we aren't much into sweet wines but wanted to try one to complement our spicy dishes.
3515,FOOD#POSITIVE,"My highlights:
oyster shooters
freshly chucked oysters
snow crab
wagyu beef slider
blackened chicken soup
creme brûlée
fresh baked chocolate chip cookie soufflé
mochi
gelato
macaroons

I would not suggest getting the 24-hour buffet deal for this particular buffet."
3516,FOOD#POSITIVE,- Mini Pots - A good portion of their buffet selection is served in mini pots or mini frier trays.
3517,FOOD#POSITIVE,:) all I know is that the food was decent and the patio & staff were great.
3518,FOOD#POSITIVE,Love how they pre-portion majority of the foods so there isn't other people digging in the same tray.
3519,FOOD#POSITIVE,"It is large and relatively diverse, but all of the dishes were fairly generic, and totally unremarkable."
3520,FOOD#POSITIVE,Super great sandwiches.
3521,FOOD#POSITIVE,There was a wide selection of assortative cheeses...Mmm...Pepper jack.
3522,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Once through, there's a plethora of seafood, meat, Asian cuisine, pastas, desserts, etc."
3523,FOOD#POSITIVE,You can easily share 1 fry between 2-3 people depending on your appetite.
3524,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They offer udon, pho, and ramen at the Asian station and fresh made tacos at the Mexican station."
3525,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Although I saw a few interesting things on the menu that I would have liked to try (bao buns, jalapeno poppers, etc."
3526,FOOD#POSITIVE,The buffet was well appointed with loads of traditional American and international choices.
3527,FOOD#POSITIVE,Their pommes frites are cute and a must try.
3528,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Obviously, tons of delicious dessert options as well --overall, lunch was a great deal at under $30 per person."
3529,FOOD#POSITIVE,Sure it's huge portions and you get your dollars worth cuz this place ain't cheap!
3530,FOOD#POSITIVE,The variety of food for lunch was pretty good.
3531,FOOD#POSITIVE,There was a vast array of items on the menu and I doubt any of them is not cooked to perfection.
3532,FOOD#POSITIVE,Lamb was falling offa the bone tender and flavor packed and the Goast Cheese w\/ Orzo Pasta was the perfect partner.
3533,FOOD#POSITIVE,"covered strawberries (although they weren't the best, but it's not in season anyways)... the highlight is prob their variety of gelato."
3534,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Ma Po Tofu - good on par with other Chinese restaurants 
Sriraricha honey glazed chicken - good, need to be a little more crisp."
3535,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Don't get me wrong, the food is great....."
3536,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Fresh salami and mortadella and proscuitto :) And there were fresh cheeses too - my fave: Smoked Gouda :) 
Being the cheap-o asian at heart, I came here on a Sunday at 2:00 pm so that I could pay Brunch price and at 3:30 dinner items start to roll out :) That means MORE variety and MORE dessert selections!"
3537,FOOD#POSITIVE,The meat section was probably the best.
3538,FOOD#POSITIVE,I loved that many of the dishes were small plated creations instead of just a big vat of orange chicken for you to scoop.
3539,FOOD#POSITIVE,The Buffet at the Wynn is one of the top tier hotel buffets in Vegas with a gourmet food selection in an upscale environment.
3540,FOOD#POSITIVE,"(just go for the sashimi)
-Asian food (dim-sum, chow mein, fried rice)
-Frozen crab legs (get the steamed crab legs, the frozen ones aren't as good once you've had the steamed)

Drinks:
-They have all kinds of crazy stuff to drink like carrot juice, etc."
3541,FOOD#POSITIVE,Both dishes were so good.
3542,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Decor is basic, nothing fancy but food is solid."
3543,FOOD#POSITIVE,There's no way to sample everything in one seating!
3544,FOOD#POSITIVE,Good selection of half bottles and wines by the glass.
3545,FOOD#POSITIVE,".Good and.poor tidbits.....love the huge, peeled shrimp, husband loves the crab,  nice meat items, lots of vegetables for a buffet, gorgeous desserts, nice selection of breads, and sliders are welconed."
3546,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I've eaten Thai food all over the country - California, Oregon, Colorado, New York, Florida, etc and this by far is the best Thai food I have ever tasted."
3547,FOOD#POSITIVE,"We don't even eat meatloaf, but it read of something he wanted to try."
3548,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Portions are a good size, so we ended up taking quite a bit of leftovers, even having ordered just two dishes."
3549,FOOD#POSITIVE,"For desserts, a lot of the smaller cake-like pastries are similar and not the best\/ worth trying."
3550,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Also, every portion size is PERFECT."
3551,FOOD#POSITIVE,I'd give the food a 3-4 stars.
3552,FOOD#POSITIVE,There was a diverse selection but I was not as impressed with the dinner options as I was when I ate brunch here in 2012.
3553,FOOD#POSITIVE,My friend and I shared that meal since it was such a huge plate of food.
3554,FOOD#POSITIVE,"To that I say, because compared to the plethora of expensive (albeit deliciously satisfying in their own right) buffets, this sandwich achieves the same result without having to worry about overstuffing yourself."
3555,FOOD#POSITIVE,The best thing: the macaroni and cheese bar!
3556,FOOD#POSITIVE,Learned about it thru the Yelp reviews and super glad we were able to check this spot out...Amazingly huge portions that the food lasted us for three days and don't worry about the wait once you get there.
3557,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They have the most yummy selection of meats, pastas, seafoods, salads, and desserts!"
3558,FOOD#POSITIVE,"SEA is good, and has other non-Thai dishes."
3559,FOOD#POSITIVE,I recommend vanilla ice cream and the vanilla sauce.
3560,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Roast beef, lamb, chicken wings, potatoes, sushi, pizza, macaroni and cheese, countless salads including bacon wedge, quinoa, waldorf, greek, fruit salads, and soup, I could go on forever."
3561,FOOD#POSITIVE,At least you'll get quality and lots of yummy choices
3562,FOOD#POSITIVE,I was very pleased with the number of sandwiches offered as well as the flavors of what I got.
3563,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I loved their sweet potato tots, steamed crab, Japanese ramen, dim sum...well I basically loved it all...Oh, and I loved the drink selection they had right by the fried food with fresh HORCHATA, pineapple juice, and many more in these cute, individual glass jars (it's the little things!)"
3564,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I wasn't expecting to finish a huge plate of crab legs by myself, but they made the process simple and it was much easier to eat!"
3565,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Also can't pass up the jumbo shrimp, although an oxymoron, these shrimps were the jumbo-ist!"
3566,FOOD#POSITIVE,"For dinner, my favorites were shrimp, crab legs, veal short ribs and prime rib."
3567,FOOD#POSITIVE,Dessert collection is great.
3568,FOOD#POSITIVE,"As for the food, my husband and I both enjoyed our steaks."
3569,FOOD#POSITIVE,Cuter than typical buffet because almost everything is served in its own containers.
3570,FOOD#POSITIVE,All kinds of varieties and pretty much everything we eat is great!
3571,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Overall, great meal and the desserts were good too."
3572,FOOD#POSITIVE,I enjoyed all my plates and dessert was delicious with lots of variety .
3573,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I tried their glazed salmon, some salads, the Korean steak, the mini-corn, French toast, gelato, goat cheese pizza, chocolate covered strawberries, an entire plate of mini-desserts, a yogurt parfait, a pain chocolate, the shrimp cocktail... and yes, I could barely move for about five hours and felt queasy during the final bite of some chocolate fudge...

but it was SO, so worth it."
3574,FOOD#POSITIVE,The king crab are a draw where most buffets only have snow crab legs.
3575,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The drink selection didn't blow us away, but by the time we got done with the bao buns, the burger and 1\/6 of the fries, we were stuffed."
3576,FOOD#POSITIVE,The presentation and number of options are impressive.
3577,FOOD#POSITIVE,Very nice selection and the staff was a great help constantly coming around asking if you want drinks and clearing your table.
3578,FOOD#POSITIVE,Large portions with creative plating.
3579,FOOD#POSITIVE,Many great selection of food and dessert so what's not to love about it?
3580,FOOD#POSITIVE,The restaurant-quality selections were well plated and tasted particularly good for having been mass produced.
3581,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I felt like I probably got my monies worth, not necessarily in the quality of the food, but rather in tons of drinks (way more than $19 worth) and great desserts."
3582,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The service here is always phenomenal, the food stellar."
3583,FOOD#POSITIVE,The seafood section has to be my favorite because there are raw oysters and crab legs!
3584,FOOD#POSITIVE,Display of food was great and buffet was very clean.
3585,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food, besides being very homey, comforting and delicious, was PURE ARTWORK on a plate."
3586,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There was a lot of variety, all organized neatly, and many of the items were quite delicious."
3587,FOOD#POSITIVE,"But hey, who cares when there is all you can eat King Crab legs and an amazingly large assortment of food, right?!"
3588,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The selections, the quality of the food, the service, it was fantastic and the price of about $22 is in line with any other breakfast buffet in town."
3589,FOOD#POSITIVE,"While this is a bit early, I highly recommend coming during brunch time because there won't be a line, there will be alot less people there, and it's almost half the price for full dinner and you still get premium items like snow crab and rock crab."
3590,FOOD#POSITIVE,Sea scallops was huge and quite filling!
3591,FOOD#POSITIVE,Terrific choices in cheese all which i purchase from my local market here in sf and arent cheap.
3592,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There are hundreds of different options for food, all which resemble a fancy private university dining hall."
3593,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I specially value the huge selection of Sushi and Japanese food--in fact, one whole pod of the buffet is dedicated to this!"
3594,FOOD#POSITIVE,The desserts were pretty but their tastes didn't match their presentations.
3595,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They have so many different options for food, so many desserts, I was in heaven."
3596,FOOD#POSITIVE,It's a giant buffet.
3597,FOOD#POSITIVE,Food was amazing.
3598,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Found the service to be very attentive, food to be top notch."
3599,FOOD#POSITIVE,I also appreciated the special touches like the fried chicken being in little fryer baskets so you're not always scooping from a giant mass of food.
3600,FOOD#POSITIVE,The menu stays fairly consistent but there is so much to choose from throughout the many stations.
3601,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Here's the quick low-down of this place:
- the sheer variety of food is dizzying so come hungry
- the food is top notch so don't feel bad if you can't get to every type of cuisine (think quality vs. quantity)
- arrive early for dinner since long lines are common place
- arrive early with another dash of early dinner since it is a walk from the entrance of the hotel (this place is kind of hidden towards the back of The Cosmopolitan)

The Wicked Spoon is a good ending to a long day of walking the strip."
3602,FOOD#POSITIVE,*Goat cheese with basil - good flavor!!
3603,FOOD#POSITIVE,Overall everyone loved the food and had a nice experience.
3604,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There were plenty of soups to try, but I didn't have room to try those, but they looked very good."
3605,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I could go on, there are A LOT of options here."
3606,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food is awesome though.
3607,FOOD#POSITIVE,You can get anything from all kinds of breakfast food to Asian food to pizza to salad.
3608,FOOD#POSITIVE,Their deserts were so delicious as well.
3609,FOOD#POSITIVE,All their dishes under $10 each so it's a great spot to fill up if you're also looking for light and healthy as well as a good budget eat in Vegas.
3610,FOOD#POSITIVE,I ate a lot of things: various meats and i think I liked the salads\/desserts the best.
3611,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Shared a strawberry sundae with my bf b\/c I know how big the portions are and I think the server was annoyed that we were sitting in his section and only ordering one item, which I get, but we were still going to tip him well."
3612,FOOD#POSITIVE,Get ready for more food then you can handle!
3613,FOOD#POSITIVE,Greetings everyone - I write this review from the afterlife as I have died and gone to Burger Heaven.
3614,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food is good overall.
3615,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Mon Ami Gabi is one of my favorite spots to have brunch in Vegas, sitting on the outdoor patio overlooking the strip with the Eiffel Tower behind me, enjoying delicious French food!"
3616,FOOD#POSITIVE,The service and food was delicious.
3617,FOOD#POSITIVE,"i love it when the egg is a little runny so that when you bite into it it breaks and makes the burger saucy - mmmMMMMMMMMmm --- the frites were scrumptious too - crisp and thin - but i love anything potatoes - mealy or crisp, french fries are always good

i also shared a spinach and cheese crepe, but that was NO GOOD - ugh, took one bite and didn't wnat to eat the rest... and i EAT ANYTHING."
3618,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Otherwise, it's a nice change from the usual typical dishes one can order."
3619,FOOD#POSITIVE,The idea of pudding on top of a shake is pure genius.
3620,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Soups in individual soup pots, vast selections of chartruccarie, cheeses, meats, seafood."
3621,FOOD#POSITIVE,This is the best Thai food you'll ever eat hands down.
3622,FOOD#POSITIVE,they have a real ice cream buffet with ~10 flavors and a sugar free part for dessert.
3623,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I enjoyed their poke, crabs, KOBE beef (1 bite from my Hubby), and dessert!"
3624,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The burger, the bun, the cheese...all perfect."
3625,FOOD#POSITIVE,"My second visit here, Food was good, nice patio seating area."
3626,FOOD#POSITIVE,Good food and very well priced.
3627,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Great prices, great view, great food."
3628,FOOD#POSITIVE,"For someone that eats a lot, their 6 inch subs hit the spot."
3629,FOOD#POSITIVE,"still, by far, the best quality food on the strip for buffets!"
3630,FOOD#POSITIVE,The American food station was fairly stocked all the time.
3631,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Overall, the experience, ambiance, and food was pretty good."
3632,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food is DELICIOUS, very well presented & the variety is INCREDIBLE!"
3633,FOOD#POSITIVE,Hands down one of the all time top 5 burgers that I tasted so far.
3634,FOOD#POSITIVE,Great assortment of international foods.
3635,FOOD#POSITIVE,"And I love the personal serving sizes of some of the food options - my favorite was the calamari, sooo good!"
3636,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Mostly with Vegas buffets or any buffet for that matter you're limited to the usual ice cream and sub par pieces of cakes, but with the Wicked Spoon you have a variety of sweets!"
3637,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They had amazing breads, vegetables, lasagna, pizzas, pastas, crab legs, lobster, shrimp, fruits, cheeses, caprese salads, ravioli's....the list goes on and on."
3638,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Like its sister restaurant in San Diego, the food at this location doesn't disappoint."
3639,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Let me preface this by saying that I am not a ""food critic"" by any means, but felt compelled to write a review describing my experience here the other night as a fan of food in large quantities (which buffets provide)."
3640,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Here's the deal: you pay $40 for decent decor, a wide selection of food, and an excellent desert bar."
3641,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed the pork\/fried rice appetizer that the waiter recommended (can't remember the name) and also ordered the chicken pad thai, red snapper over drunken noodles, and the crispy duck curry."
3642,FOOD#POSITIVE,The selection and quality of Asian food was above some of the other high end buffets on the strip.
3643,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There are TONS and TONS of different types of food here, and the buffet spread is loooooooooong and probably goes on for a mile or two."
3644,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Over all, a huge selection of food with a lot of light options, so that you can try a lot of awesome food that you wouldn't normally get to eat without feeling disgustingly full."
3645,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Its also pretty expensive, but if you come hungry and enjoy eating crab legs\/shrimp\/prime rib\/all food, you'll have yourself a good time."
3646,FOOD#POSITIVE,The interior of the restaurant is classy and full of varieties of wines.
3647,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Most notably - the dessert - I don't even have a sweet tooth, but I'd say the dessert offerings alone warranted the price alone."
3648,FOOD#POSITIVE,Great meal for a reasonable price in las Vegas.
3649,FOOD#POSITIVE,"If you do choose Mon Ami Gabi, just simply order a bottle of wine and order the children's Mac n cheese and watch the strip without wasting time with the food that only the most unsophisticated tourist would find palatable."
3650,FOOD#POSITIVE,"It definitely hit the spot, as in, when you don't know what to eat and feel like being adventurous and finding a hidden gem."
3651,FOOD#POSITIVE,I will have to say that I didn't try even half of the food available so they may deserve more than a three.
3652,FOOD#POSITIVE,I was happy to see choices that wouldn't normally be at a buffet.
3653,FOOD#POSITIVE,The decor and lighting in the area was great (just like the rest of the hotel) and the overall taste of the food was satisfying.
3654,FOOD#POSITIVE,But what sets this place apart are the parmesan truffle fries and the milkshakes.
3655,FOOD#POSITIVE,Many different food stations with tons of great choices.
3656,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Duck confit ravioli, KBBQ ribs (though not the best), mac and cheese bar, tiny portioned out salads, fried chicken, charcuterie station, and those random little dishes that have a different twist of flavors that you won't find at other buffets make me enjoy the difference here."
3657,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food is delicious, everyone enjoyed their meals..."
3658,FOOD#POSITIVE,I live in Vegas and go there a lot because the food is spectacular.
3659,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food is the best I've had.
3660,FOOD#POSITIVE,"You can get breakfast or brunch in the morning, lunch, dinner, and gourmet dinner options."
3661,FOOD#POSITIVE,And the food tastes great.
3662,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The room is beautiful as well, and the $50\/pp cost seemed reasonable to us, considering the variety - you could have a 4-course meal, and the desserts were out of this world -- again, small and manageable to try a bunch."
3663,FOOD#POSITIVE,That was all I ate that night since there was nothing else to eat.
3664,FOOD#POSITIVE,We chose the Bellagio because of the seafood offering.
3665,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Wicked Spoon does have several appeals though--sexy ambiance, free flowing water, and tapa-style individual portions."
3666,FOOD#POSITIVE,I love their ice cream selection.
3667,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The most memorable options from Bacchanal: 

- My fave was the Thai Curry mussels."
3668,FOOD#POSITIVE,"It was close to our hotel, offered bottomless brunch cocktails (for an extra $10 charge -- fair enough), super impressive selection, great quality of food and attentive service."
3669,FOOD#POSITIVE,Fairly good thai food but they don't really take reservations (they take phone reservations but its impossible to get through) and a lot of people came and left disappointed when we were waiting.
3670,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Lots of different food; impressive Asian selection along with made to order noodle soups - got the ramen and well, ti was good."
3671,FOOD#POSITIVE,The selection is wonderfully delicious!
3672,FOOD#POSITIVE,Nice selection of various cuisines.
3673,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I would definitely go back here again....good food, good service, good view and good friends."
3674,FOOD#POSITIVE,"would easily cost this much per person anywhere in Vegas, and you wouldn't have the huge selection."
3675,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Champagne is great, view of Bellagio fountains is amazing and the food and service is choice!"
3676,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Just when you think you've seen all of the selections, just turn the corner in the dining room and...BAM!"
3677,FOOD#POSITIVE,This place has some really good sandwiches.
3678,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There were plenty of salads and sides to eat, and the vegan ice cream and cookies were excellent."
3679,FOOD#POSITIVE,They run less than $10 and are a good size to keep you full.
3680,FOOD#POSITIVE,This buffet is amazing for anyone but especially wonderful for someone who is gluten free.
3681,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I thought this would be another over hyped celebrity restaurant...but no, one of the best burgers I have ever had."
3682,FOOD#POSITIVE,"That kind of thing doesn't bother me, but I would prefer my eggs to be cooked correctly."
3683,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Some of the food was excellent: pancakes, country potatoes with lobster, sausage from the carving station, lox and definitely more but I can't remember all of it."
3684,FOOD#POSITIVE,"So if you're a wine lover, you're in for a treat!"
3685,FOOD#POSITIVE,Came here for lunch and had to wait an hour which is worth the wait since their food is huge!
3686,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food was very good overall and so was the service.
3687,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Good variety of ""lighter"" food fare (think cheeses, salads, breads)."
3688,FOOD#POSITIVE,So many items at this buffet!
3689,FOOD#POSITIVE,This is THE buffet where you can truly dine like the gods.
3690,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They have a wide range of options (7 stations), from breakfast foods, to fresh salads, to fried, to pastas, to asian foods, and even a whole dessert bar!"
3691,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Food was so good, I can't wait to come back!"
3692,FOOD#POSITIVE,Steaks are great and service is top notch.
3693,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Aside from the crab legs, there's a ton of other great food---for example:
- mushroom risotto cakes in pea puree
- spaghetti squash au gratin with white truffle oil
- rigatoni in a gorgonzola cream sauce
- poached pear and blue cheese walnut salad
- lychee infused fruit salad
- chipotle rubbed chicken thigh
- rotisserie game hen
- prime rib (of course)
- delicious sushi
- tons of shrimp cocktail
- flatbread pizza
- great dessert: fresh ice cream, sorbet, cupcakes and other desserts

Overall, very very satisfied with the buffet and had a delicious meal."
3694,FOOD#POSITIVE,Great quality buffet food with extremely bad service
3695,FOOD#POSITIVE,The portions are a great size but alot of the dishes lacked flavor.
3696,FOOD#POSITIVE,The dessert table is its own little island... BEST TASTING DESSERTS AT A BUFFET HANDS DOWN!
3697,FOOD#POSITIVE,I saved half of the food for later and ate it after a night of drinking.
3698,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food was pretty good too and the dessert spread had a good variety of goodies.
3699,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I'm pretty sure I've ordered the same thing, The Full Montagu, all 3 times I've been to EoS, but why mess with something good?"
3700,FOOD#POSITIVE,Good variety great price and cool ambiance.
3701,FOOD#POSITIVE,The service was super quick and in no time we were gorging on the food :) The portions were huge and the presentation...OHH my my!!!
3702,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The dessert station also has a vast selection that would satisfy anyone's sweet tooth (gelato, sorbetto, creme brulee, pies, cakes, macaron, cookies, and more!)."
3703,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They had a bunch of breads, mexican foods, sushi, pizza, soups, and this seafood puff pastry thing they made by request."
3704,FOOD#POSITIVE,Lunch is not bad compared to dinner but there are so many breakfast options to choose from that it does not make the pricing for the lunch option as appealing compared to dinner.
3705,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Use to go to the Wynn Buffet
Now I am going both
I woudn't be able to choose which one is the best
Food is excellent and various
LOVE IT"
3706,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The cuisine could, at best, be described as French-American fusion."
3707,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food options are definitely plentiful with oysters, crab legs, lobster rolls, etc in the seafood section, sausages, prime rib, filet, lamb chops etc in the carving station, and a variety of  different ethnic foods in the back."
3708,FOOD#POSITIVE,Something about all that food just sitting there and too many selections is overwhelming to me.
3709,FOOD#POSITIVE,- the treats section is awesome.
3710,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They have a really good range of choice - curry, roast, salad, sushi, pizza, plus a bit dessert selection."
3711,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I love good corned beef hash, so this place, which was a block away seemed perfect."
3712,FOOD#POSITIVE,I'm a pescatarian = i eat fish but NO MEAT\/PORK\/POULTRY anything with a personality I won't eat :) the options for me here were ENDLESS!!
3713,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food is decent and the service was better this time than it was the last time.
3714,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Okay, I'll give our server her pride in the food that Hash House makes since it was all well presented, very plentiful and quite delicious!"
3715,FOOD#POSITIVE,I also had a few slices of fresh pineapple which were sweet and some chocolate ice cream\/gelato and macarons.
3716,FOOD#POSITIVE,It was so good that I had to eat extra fast so he couldn't ask for another bite.
3717,FOOD#POSITIVE,nice buffet lots of choices...I agree with another reviewer (Jacqueline L) that the desserts were amazing and the Asian selections were not the best.
3718,FOOD#POSITIVE,They have an amazing aray of desserts from cupcakes to mini tiramisu to gelato to creme brulee.
3719,FOOD#POSITIVE,If I was craving for anything they would have definitely had it at the buffet.
3720,FOOD#POSITIVE,One of my favorite items were the sweet potato tater tots.
3721,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food is too big and i always end up giving the left overs to  the less fortunate who sit on the bridges\/streets.
3722,FOOD#POSITIVE,"But once you walk in the door you are very nicely surprised at the decor, the lively ambiance, and the large array of wines."
3723,FOOD#POSITIVE,The dinner buffet was SO good.
3724,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Make your own taco's, Fresh to slice BBQ, Amazing Shrimp cocktail, Asian foods, Italian treats."
3725,FOOD#POSITIVE,What i noticed about WIcked Spoon was that they have higher end food items available then other buffets.
3726,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food is still good and the service is also still very attentive!
3727,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I loved that the dining room had more of a large restaurant feel than a buffet look, and that the portions were individual instead of shady looking trays of food that look like they have been sitting out all day."
3728,FOOD#POSITIVE,The mashed potatoes alone can have their own septet ate review of awesomeness.
3729,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Price:
Breakfast: $18.99 (Mon-Fri\/ 7am-11am
Lunch: $22.99 (11am-330pm)
Dinner: $33.99 (Mon-Thur 330-1000)
Gourmet dinner: $39.99 (Fri-Sat\/330-1000)

Food:
Now like all buffets in Vegas, they love to prepare dishes from around the world."
3730,FOOD#POSITIVE,Alcohol is always surprising inexpressive for a strip location.
3731,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The menu looks ordinary, but everything I had was really good."
3732,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There was a pretty good selection of different dishes (a good choice of fish and meat), but it doesn't stand out from all the other buffets on the strip at Vegas."
3733,FOOD#POSITIVE,The Earl's Cobb Wrap - This wrap variation of their most popular hot sandwich is just as memorable.
3734,FOOD#POSITIVE,Get a large and share it with someone.
3735,FOOD#POSITIVE,I can't really complain because even the buffet pizza is delicious.
3736,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The bottom line is that it's GREAT food on the Vegas strip, which is sometimes really hard to find."
3737,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food is exceptional and the service is friendly.
3738,FOOD#POSITIVE,Fact - Their dim sum is better than most regular Chinese dim sum places I've been to in Orange County.
3739,FOOD#POSITIVE,"- Dim sim was solid 
- Ambience was good: comfortable & clean 
- Food was constantly getting refilled 
- Good selection of desserts: Gelato, Crepe Station, cake pops, strawberries dipped in chocolate, egg tarts, assortment of pastries and fruit, etc."
3740,FOOD#POSITIVE,The 5 Star rating speaks more the to wonderful time (including the food and service) and over-all experience rather than just the food.
3741,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Their best  dishes, in my opinion, are expressed through the Northern Thai selection on the menu."
3742,FOOD#POSITIVE,Well they do have a lot of food to select from HOWEVER their Dungeness crab was really disappointing...it looked like something they swept up from the floor.
3743,FOOD#POSITIVE,dessert bar was good.
3744,FOOD#POSITIVE,I would recommend this place if you're looking for a good authentic Thai restaurant near the strip.
3745,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Food: --\/5
Service: -3\/5 (Yes, NEGATIVE 3 out of +5)
Atmosphere: 4\/5 (looked like a beautiful place to have brunch from the entrance)

This is a review of the time I spent outside of the buffet."
3746,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food is to die for.
3747,FOOD#POSITIVE,"As you'll see from photos, the serving sizes are obnoxiously large...  the kids meal we got was only $6 and also huge."
3748,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They have steamed crabs, which isn't uncommon to have here in vegas, but it's nice that they provide it."
3749,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I was wrong, I thought it was one of the tastiest sandwich spots I have ever tried."
3750,FOOD#POSITIVE,So went to Vegas oh we could go for a Bashlor party and I got everyone hyped up to go to the Bellagio buffet where I heard it was one of the best buffets rated in the world and I was really excited to go so we went out to Vegas did our Vegas thing and got everyone to go eat at the  buffet and as an avid buffet go or I would give this only three stars they had really good food but from the hype that I've heard and only having four options for sushi I was disappointed for a $50 buffet so if you want your bang for the buck explore explore explore is plenty of awesome places to eat in Vegas and this is the place I will never go to again
3751,FOOD#POSITIVE,also plenty of healthy choices!
3752,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Highlights included the bone marrow, the mac n cheese bar, the chicken wings, the ceviche and other small seafood dishes, and the chocolate lava cake (which tasted more like a souffle) for dessert."
3753,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Medium spicy was enough to make me sweat

Best meal I have had in Vegas on my own dime"
3754,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The decor, the seating arrangements, the buffet layout, 9 stations of wondrously delicious food.. some individually plated, some AYCE.. give a plate to the crab leg guy , get a plate back of deliciously fresh, hot & steamy legs.. ;) The little sliders were AMAZING.. chicken & waffle portions... chicken wings, hot wings, drumsticks, onion rings, tater tots.. omg."
3755,FOOD#POSITIVE,"BBQ\/American section: Coleslaw and other cold salads, corn on the cob, Mac and cheese, baked beans, 4 kinds of sausage, ribs, ham, brisket, corn dogs, waffle fries, mini sliders (no good), normal tater tots, sweet potato tater tots, truffle potatoes Au gratin, fried chicken and sweet potato fries."
3756,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They make taco's as u order, had a mexican area, american, japanese."
3757,FOOD#POSITIVE,"She is like an Asian food master queen, and I'm that passionate about this restaurant."
3758,FOOD#POSITIVE,The bun was fresh and the burger was a nice size.
3759,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Although I'm a fan of the fancy cuts of meat and all that, the eggs benedict and their hollandaise sauce were an unexpected highlight to the meal."
3760,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Great service, nice atmosphere, food is not at all my thing - big portions of mediocre carbs and grease."
3761,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Yes, my heaven is a ginormous room with endless food and talented chefs."
3762,FOOD#POSITIVE,Great service and great food as well.
3763,FOOD#POSITIVE,Portions are huge and the prices are so reasonable for a restaurant in a Casino!
3764,FOOD#POSITIVE,Went during July 4th weekend so it was great crowd + great food and great drinks!
3765,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food was delicious, and they had a wide variety of authentic Thai food on their menu."
3766,FOOD#POSITIVE,Atmosphere is nice  and great selection of wine.
3767,FOOD#POSITIVE,"We went here for dinner and it was great, the service was spectacular as was the meal and appetizers."
3768,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food other than the omelet bar was delicious!
3769,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The first sip was light, frothy, creamy, with just the right amount of oreo embedded into each slurp."
3770,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The dishes I chose for my second round weren't as memorable, not for lack of taste and quality, but for my sudden onset of gluttony taking over and turning my memory into a fuzzy haze of delicious food."
3771,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The sush iis fresh, the seafood, the Italian antipasta, the list goes on with high end individual food dishes.Even the deserts where outstanding, usually buffet deserts are tasteless but the pastries here were amazing."
3772,FOOD#POSITIVE,I had the classic earl for the first time and it was GREAT.
3773,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food choices were pretty amazing & its spread out so that it isn't too overwhelming.
3774,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I love meat and TRUST honey, the meat was plentiful."
3775,FOOD#POSITIVE,Their menu is huge and I'm sure I didn't order the most adventuresome dishes since I wanted to be able to compare their dishes to ones I am familiar with.
3776,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Despite the arm and leg you have to offer to be seated at this establishment, I'd have to say the food is to die for."
3777,FOOD#POSITIVE,"At $51 per person for dinner, it is a decent value for unlimited quantities of good food."
3778,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I was impressed with their noodle section, serving both ramen and pho."
3779,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Word to the wise- go with other people... that way you can steal, i mean, taste, each sandwich."
3780,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There are so many options to choose from, &at the same time you're paying for the experience."
3781,FOOD#POSITIVE,But this is a slow burn type of heat... then we shared a shrimp fried rice (which I would skip because you can have this at any restaurant in any city Usa... there was nothing special about this dish) then we shared the garlic prawns which are delicious and don't shy away from the fried heads they are delicious.
3782,FOOD#POSITIVE,BEYOND delicious and for sure better than any other buffet I have ever tried.
3783,FOOD#POSITIVE,I'll admit the food options was fantastic asking with my favorite king crab legs and medium sized cocktail shrimp but the Bellagio Buffet and the Bachannel Buffet at Caesars were much better.
3784,FOOD#POSITIVE,Selection was quite impressive with a lot of variety.
3785,FOOD#POSITIVE,"SECOND COURSE
Breakfast Quesadilla (Scrambled Eggs, Potatoes & Bacon Quesadilla served with Sour Cream, Guacamole & Pico de Gallo):
-Extremely hearty!"
3786,FOOD#POSITIVE,"And all the usual seafoods, sushi, carved meats - the food was great, ambiance was fun too."
3787,FOOD#POSITIVE,Food and service was great!
3788,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The presentation is spot-on, and even the tables, chairs, and surrounding decorations are very impressive."
3789,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Nothing seemed fresh, the food looked as though it was presented well, but tasted like stale leftovers (I hate leftovers)."
3790,FOOD#POSITIVE,:) My friend squeezed lemon all over this and we had our choices of creamy sauces on the side.
3791,FOOD#POSITIVE,"the buffet is spread with tons of seafood, sushi, different types of meat, salads, sides, bread, soup, and more!"
3792,FOOD#POSITIVE,What's good about this place is that they offer a terrific variety of dishes and don't just rely on the old standards like crab legs and prime rib to keep customers happy.
3793,FOOD#POSITIVE,Food: Great burgers!!!
3794,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food was awesome overall.
3795,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Yes, the buffet is pretty special - there's so much to choose from."
3796,FOOD#POSITIVE,Had a ton of yummy drinks to choose from; might come back to try one or two.
3797,FOOD#POSITIVE,My stomach feels like it was hit by a tornado but the food was great.
3798,FOOD#POSITIVE,The variety is endless especially because they have dishes from all types of cultures and different cuisines.
3799,FOOD#POSITIVE,"When our filet mignons came, my mouth instantly watered like Homer Simpson when he sees a donut."
3800,FOOD#POSITIVE,How do you expect us to have a dinner if you can't even fit all the food on the table!
3801,FOOD#POSITIVE,"A really tasty breakfast with tons and tons of great sounding food options and really interesting drink choices, you've got to come give it a shot."
3802,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Macarons were the perfect texture, I had bites of the blueberry, orange, and pistachio flavors."

3807,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food was superb, the staff was really on point even to the point of cleaning up the crumbs that were on our table."
3808,FOOD#POSITIVE,I first had this sandwich in 2011 and I keep ordering it every chance I get because it is one of those things that you start to crave!!!
3809,FOOD#POSITIVE,"If you're in town for their limited time ""Turkey Holiday"", I must say, YOU HAVE TO TRY IT."
3810,FOOD#POSITIVE,"My husband was a bit disappointed in the breakfast sandwich, he felt it was to small but tasted good."
3811,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food is really good but as far as variety and taste, I still give Wynn or Belagio Buffet the medal."
3812,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They have 4 sections for you endulgence and develop a food coma: asian (peeing duck, sushi, noodles), Italian (pizza, pasta, cheese,  cured meats), American  (Bbq, mac n cheese,  fried edibles ), seafood ( raw bar, snowcrab, shrimp cocktail) AND ALOT MORE."
3813,FOOD#POSITIVE,It will be hard to try everything in the buffet unless u are fatter than me.
3814,FOOD#POSITIVE,Food was on point.
3815,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I was expecting something more like steak fries, which I'm not a HUGE fan of, and the crispy delicious little potato ribbons got even better when dragged through some of the extra merlot butter."
3816,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Positives:  the decor was very nice and the wait staff was very friendly and timely, no line and was seated immediately(Thursday night), the shrimp ceviche, prime rib, baked salmon, and several of the pasta dishes were very good."
3817,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Good quick food, and helpfully cheaper than a lot of the other options around."
3818,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I ordered the $13 American Burger...It was an above average burger, featuring high quality beef, ripe tomato, butter lettuce and nice cheese on a fresh bun."
3819,FOOD#POSITIVE,It has a great taste and presentation.
3820,FOOD#POSITIVE,The hubster enjoyed his sandwich and I thought it was a good price for how big it was.
3821,FOOD#POSITIVE,Good service and good food.
3822,FOOD#POSITIVE,We went for dinner and there was so much to choose from.
3823,FOOD#POSITIVE,"If you like eggs (particularly ones with runny yolk), especially if you've never gotten an egg with your burger... You MUST get the farm burger, hands down."
3824,FOOD#POSITIVE,In the middle of the dining room is a desserts and bakery nook that has an assortment of all kinds of sweets that you would think came out of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory.
3825,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food itself was pretty good, but for time lost that could have been spent enjoying a meal together this place gets only two stars."
3826,FOOD#POSITIVE,Dipping sauces were on point!
3827,FOOD#POSITIVE,By far the best burgers in Vegas .
3828,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I'm talking prime rib, sliced turkey, Mexican, Italian, yogurt bar, omelet bar, pancake bar, fresh fruit, Asian food, seafood, bacon, ham, sausage, potatoes, mash potatoes, and a HUGE room full of pastries, ice cream, etc."
3829,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food is so fresh, and there are so many choices."
3830,FOOD#POSITIVE,The presentation of the food was very modern.
3831,FOOD#POSITIVE,This place is amazing open 24hrs and with the portions they give you might need every bit of 24hrs to finish your food.
3832,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Save room for dessert, we tried two different ones during our trip and preferred the Sundae's over the frozen hot chocolate which is really a glorified $11 milkshake...the sundae however was amazing!"
3833,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The other food is good too, & it's fun to sit out on the terrace and people watch (since it's on the strip)."
3834,FOOD#POSITIVE,The Chinese food is good.
3835,FOOD#POSITIVE,The dessert section has a good spread of sweets.
3836,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The fries came with different condiments, one of which was curry ketchup, a staple in many European countries and a condiment that just can't seem to make it in the United States."
3837,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food is very fresh and there's an awesome variety.
3838,FOOD#POSITIVE,The desserts and service were decent; tonkatsu ramen was surprisingly good.
3839,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Weekend brunch is usally the bestbet then the dinner, try not to go there during lunch, since the selection is not as good then night time."
3840,FOOD#POSITIVE,It's pricy but the food simply cannot be beat.
3841,FOOD#POSITIVE,Not as many choices as some of the other buffets on the strip but the quality of food is good.
3842,FOOD#POSITIVE,"So this time around the price and selection increased, but I did not mind considering the fact that they now served prime rib, lamb, smoked salmon and much more!"
3843,FOOD#POSITIVE,The menu has all sorts of fun and unique offerings such as a banana latte and banana and maple sugar pancakes.
3844,FOOD#POSITIVE,He liked the pasta bar where they made you your own pasta dish.
3845,FOOD#POSITIVE,The buffet did the trick - offered up a lot of selections - I am wondering how it would have differed at lunch.
3846,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Well, the food is unique and there are so many tasty options."
3847,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Very good variety, love the different fruit and vegetable juices"
3848,FOOD#POSITIVE,Easily one of the most over priced buffets in Vegas due to the quality of food and service.
3849,FOOD#POSITIVE,Praying for another stomach because the food was so good and I wanted to eat as much as of it as I can.
3850,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The dessert section has a large variety of pastries, cakes and yummy, creamy gelato!"
3851,FOOD#POSITIVE,This is definitely a share everything type of place (because of the size and the prices).
3852,FOOD#POSITIVE,Overwhelming does not even describe the amount of food you are brought ...
3853,FOOD#POSITIVE,I felt like I paid more for presentation than taste.
3854,FOOD#POSITIVE,I was full within 3 dishes but they offer a great selection of food with GOOD quality as well.
3855,FOOD#POSITIVE,"mexican kitchen didn't do anything for me so i skipped that as well as the salad and asian kitchen, maybe only trying the roast duck and i got grossed out since it was too lumpy and the day that i went, such area of the buffet really didnt sold out as the rest."
3856,FOOD#POSITIVE,They have a great selection and nothing was spit out bad (like most vegas buffets) there was one section with mini cups of experimental fruits and spices; its a must try and was stand out from the whole buffet.
3857,FOOD#POSITIVE,"To me, nothing beats a homemade burger, but I have to say, this place overtook that spot."
3858,FOOD#POSITIVE,"For all you out of town folks who've heard about Serendipity, my advice is to visit the location for some frozen hot chocolate or just a sundae (and share it with like 10 of your friends)."
3859,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Awesome presentation, with a stick of rosemary anchoring it down."
3860,FOOD#POSITIVE,Burgers were amazing just a little under cooked for me.
3861,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Food was outstanding, I recommend splitting a dish between at least two people."
3862,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The buffet itself has a variety of foods: seafood, Asian food, Mexican, breakfast foods, and good old American."
3863,FOOD#POSITIVE,"If you're here for brunch, what's nice is you can add to you alcohol intake for the day by getting bottomless mimosas (because why not, Viva Las Vegaaaaas after all)!"
3864,FOOD#POSITIVE,Food:  Very good for a buffet.
3865,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Delicious, but I didn't have a bread plate..."
3866,FOOD#POSITIVE,"), and a bunch of different types of ice cream."
3867,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone, especially those needing a gluten free menu."
3868,FOOD#POSITIVE,They had a variety of other dishes including asian meals (weak sushi though) but great korean bbq ribs.
3869,FOOD#POSITIVE,"3.5 stars - food is good but service is spotty

We are here for a conference and took a customer for lunch."
3870,FOOD#POSITIVE,"However, when it comes to buffets, I leave full but not completely satisfied."
3871,FOOD#POSITIVE,Nothing extremely memorable about the food.
3872,FOOD#POSITIVE,The dishes are all served on small plates which makes it easier to sample a wide variety of foods without over doing it.
3873,FOOD#POSITIVE,Its about the same price as the cheap stuff in the Belagio or Aria and it's On Point!
3874,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They have seafood, BBQ, comfort foods, Mexican, Italian, Chinese, and Japanese - maybe a few others that I may have missed."
3875,FOOD#POSITIVE,Food looks really pretty but it tastes terrible.
3876,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Portions are large, food is fresh, service is prompt....bloody Mary's are sooooo good!!!"
3877,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I highly recommend the buffet to vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores alike."
3878,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Great views, great service, great food."
3879,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Our food took a little longer than usual to come out, so our sever gave us a complimentary frozen hot chocolate which hit the spot."
3880,FOOD#POSITIVE,The BEST place for a late night (and anytime) sandwich.
3881,FOOD#POSITIVE,I love their vegetable section.
3882,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They have an unlimited wine special for about $8 a glass, and the house wine is pretty good."
3883,FOOD#POSITIVE,Can't ask for a better way to eat food instead if spending tons of money
3884,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I also loved their desserts selection which had  bite sized desserts like carrot cake, smores cake, Apple pie, various kinds of soufflés and pies."
3885,FOOD#POSITIVE,Hit the bar in the restaurant where we were given a thick ass drink menu i mean thick!!
3886,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The location is a bit dingy from the outside, but you can't argue with the results of the food."
3887,FOOD#POSITIVE,There's no arguing that this place has variety over just about every other buffet in Vegas.
3888,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Crab legs were good, but other buffet places have that also."
3889,FOOD#POSITIVE,I did LOVE the presentation of it.
3890,FOOD#POSITIVE,"A lot of options, from excellent mini-waffles to FIVE types of ceviche."
3891,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The best appetizer is the warm brie cheese on bread with black pepper honey drizzle, roasted garlic and nuts."
3892,FOOD#POSITIVE,Overwhelming amount of choices.
3893,FOOD#POSITIVE,The gourmet and the comfort food options are plenty and a lot of them served up in individual portions.
3894,FOOD#POSITIVE,The highlight for me was the thai dishes I had never seen before.
3895,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Great brunch spot for mimosas, bloodies and a guaranteed good meal."
3896,FOOD#POSITIVE,They have a nice selection of food This place uses real good quality meat.
3897,FOOD#POSITIVE,High end knowledgable bar service - excellent French styled cuisine.
3898,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food alone makes the price worthwhile, but it's even more reasonable when compared to the other buffets on the strip."
3899,FOOD#POSITIVE,I had the crab legs which were good like any other crab leg buffet.
3900,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Admittedly, there are a wide variety of choices on their menu."
3901,FOOD#POSITIVE,I'll go back the next time I'm in vegas for another frozen hot chocolate ( probably will share between 2 people)  because serendipity is so cute!
3902,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Good sandwich, but not 4.5 star good."
3903,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food was just as good as before, but the service was ehh this time around."
3904,FOOD#POSITIVE,But what made this a 4 star review was the Gelato Bar.
3905,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Typical buffet with meat, seafood, mexican, asian, italian and american.... the quality of the food is a lot better than most vegas buffets...The lambchops were superb!!!"
3906,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There are just too many options for me to list my fav items here, so i guess I'll have to make you go there!!"
3907,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I think for $50 per person it didn't wow me as much as I think it should, there is a huge selection of food but nothing stood out."
3908,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The fries looked nice, but they too, were bland."
3909,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Pizza was great, especially when it came out fresh out of the oven."
3910,FOOD#POSITIVE,"To top it off, the desert stations has way too many goodies to choose from with some amazingly good Gelato to satisfy your sweet tooth."
3911,FOOD#POSITIVE,Awesome food and huge quantities ... You fat people will especially love it.
3912,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The selection is pretty good and it actually tastes good too.. Buffets in Rio or planet Hollywood might have alot, but you get one thing and everything tastes the same.... Tuna tar tar.. Tastes like the orange chicken..... At least here everything has a distinct taste.. And is good =] ( PS...good hang over food and bonding, from partying and throwing up the night before at  Marquee ;) lol"
3913,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I would go hungry, you have a lot of food to work though."
3914,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The fries were cut really small and were pretty crisp, which is normally not my favorite way to serve them, but I thought they were surprisingly good!"
3915,FOOD#POSITIVE,Truthfully the food here was better than the food we got at Gordon Ramsay Steak.
3916,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Some of the best food I've had anywhere, all ready instantly, all prepared in a visually pleasing way."
3917,FOOD#POSITIVE,Like half of the food offered came in little pots were I believe the portion was just right cause we all know you have to strategize when eating a buffet  and not overload on one particular food.
3918,FOOD#POSITIVE,"As a Vegas Local, this is my FAVORITE people watching, fountain watching, bottle of wine spot."
3919,FOOD#POSITIVE,The husband got the Hawaiian BBQ sandwich and loved that too.
3920,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They have a wide range of different food, and I think that it is really worth the slightly higher price one has to pay for this buffet as compared to the other cheaper ones!"
3921,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The best item I had, and I tried most, was the Steamed BBQ Pork Bun."
3922,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Good food , LARGE servings and a hipster ambience."
3923,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Go to the lunch if possible, pretty much the same food for half the price."
3924,FOOD#POSITIVE,While there was a large section I really focus on a few things and if they are done well.
3925,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The portions on our meals were huge, so we didn't leave hungry."
3926,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Great selection, -2 stars for horrible service!"
3927,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I do have to say though, that the presentation is totally adorable and that is the only reason they get a star."
3928,FOOD#POSITIVE,We were staying at the Mirage and they were charging the same price for buffet but I'm confident you're not going to find the same type of food and same quality of food elsewhere.
3929,FOOD#POSITIVE,a $6 amazing sandwich at any hour of the day in Vegas?
3930,FOOD#POSITIVE,Presentation added a bunch to the taste I am sure!
3931,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Overall, great sandwiches and good for quick bites and late nights."
3932,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Everyone had great food, heard wonderful things about the french onion soup, the trout, the salmon, the mussels and the salads."
3933,FOOD#POSITIVE,There's a lot of good meat here.
3934,FOOD#POSITIVE,The buffet has the best gelato offerings I've see at any buffet.
3935,FOOD#POSITIVE,Great variety of food from around the world.
3936,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Good breakfast foods, especially the bacon."
3937,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Once seated, we looked over the menu and decided we would share our food."
3938,FOOD#POSITIVE,The dessert section was lacking (although the chocolate dipped strawberries were good) and the bone marrow had a herb crusted topping that took away all of the natural flavor.
3939,FOOD#POSITIVE,You can get a awesome smash burger... And smash fries for under $10.
3940,FOOD#POSITIVE,I'm a big fan of Gordon Ramsey so I had high expectations about this place and I'm happy to say that the food was beyond of what I expected.
3941,FOOD#POSITIVE,I find it very difficult to find Eggs Benedict at a regular breakfast joint but the Bellagio Brunch will make you cry tears of joy.
3942,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I indulged in fresh crab, steamed mussels, classic clams in white wine sauce, shrimps, sashimi, scallop salad,...   Their salads are great too."
3943,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Tip: their portions are huge so if you are staying at a hotel with no fridge for your leftovers, I suggest sharing!"
3944,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Diverse menu, friendly staff and busy atmosphere."
3945,FOOD#POSITIVE,It was so much food I barely even finished half of it.
3946,FOOD#POSITIVE,Extremely delicate and all items are French Bakery quality.
3947,FOOD#POSITIVE,Good service by waitstaff and I think the food is good quality - keeping in mind this is a buffet.
3948,FOOD#POSITIVE,Hash House A Go Go at the Linq hotel is an awesome place to catch a good breakfast.
3949,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The real thing that sets it apart from other buffets I've been to (I live in Reno, so a fair amount of experience with them) was the lack of large chaffing dishes."
3950,FOOD#POSITIVE,"It was really good and I would have eaten more, I was just not feeling well the second half of the day."
3951,FOOD#POSITIVE,I like how the majority of the selections were pre-plated in individual bowls\/plates.
3952,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Service, atmosphere, food - everything was perfect and an amazing deal!"
3953,FOOD#POSITIVE,The customer service was phenomenal and food was amazing!
3954,FOOD#POSITIVE,I also enjoyed the dessert bar as well.
3955,FOOD#POSITIVE,Everything was well well seasoned and delicious including the French loaf that comes with your meal.
3956,FOOD#POSITIVE,The plain chocolate cake was also heaven for a chocolate lover like me.
3957,FOOD#POSITIVE,It's definitely bigger than the normal crepes you can get at the crepe stand inside Paris.
3958,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Even though the food was AMAZING, our waitress Kaysea, made our experience even better."
3959,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They have breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert - whatever your heart desires."
3960,FOOD#POSITIVE,"!....it probably took us 25 mins to eat dinner, about 45 for dessert (i insisted on trying at least one bite everything, so i had to take breaks in between rounds), and then another 15 of just sitting still passing in and out of a food comatose at the table."
3961,FOOD#POSITIVE,They have a nice variety of food.
3962,FOOD#POSITIVE,The taco stand was pretty awesome with a wide variety of home made salsas.
3963,FOOD#POSITIVE,I also love their prime ribs and desert selection.
3964,FOOD#POSITIVE,You get your money's worth with the level of food served here.
3965,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There's certainly something for everyone on the menu but with a twist that's a bit ""en Francais""."
3966,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Food, Service, Location deserves the 5 stars, but cannot hand those ratings out with impunity."
3967,FOOD#POSITIVE,They are all served in cutesy glass bottles.
3968,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Flavor wise its pretty close, I would like to say WS is slightly better but then it depends on what you eat."
3969,FOOD#POSITIVE,The portions for the food are HUGE!
3970,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The carving station presented ham, some kind of stuffed chicken, some type of lamb, which looked great but I'm not a lamb person."
3971,FOOD#POSITIVE,The desserts are sinfully good.
3972,FOOD#POSITIVE,"the buffet here at lunch is great , def try it out best thai food in vegas"
3973,FOOD#POSITIVE,"After recommending this place to my friend, he told me he had ""food twins"" after eating--yes, food twins, not just a food baby."
3974,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Far too much food for my typical morning meal but I wasn't complaining, everything tasted great."
3975,FOOD#POSITIVE,The Asian section towards the back end of the buffet was my favorite.
3976,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food was excellent, the service was friendly, but lacked attention and was super slow pace, because of that it's 3 or 3 1\/2 stars not 4."
3977,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Because it's not only a steakhouse, you get a fantastic menu with seafood, steaks, poultry and a small amount of vegetarian fare."
3978,FOOD#POSITIVE,"We are talking a tower of bacon stuffed waffles, perfectly tender sage fried chicken Breasts (wing tip left in for presentation), a hot maple reduction sauce drizzled around the edges of the plate and fried leaks..  oh so many fried leaks along with little kernels of corn sprinkled throughout."
3979,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Their thick steak fries are amazing (and I prefer thinner ones) and come with tasty different ketchups, including a chipotle and a curry choice."
3980,FOOD#POSITIVE,They have so much food its so overwhelming at first.
3981,FOOD#POSITIVE,Khao sui s a wonderful noodles in a curry dish with beautiful colors n texture.
3982,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There is a dessert station, a crab station as well as an Asian food station but a great many of the main dishes have to be passed on your way to the carving stations which are at the end of a long buffet line ...so you have to walk along a buffet line passing several dishes that you do not want to get to the carving  station and at the same time blocking people who want one of those main  dishes and not the carving station."
3983,FOOD#POSITIVE,But the real shocker was how delicious everything was.
3984,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The truffle fries were good, I like just about anything with truffle."
3985,FOOD#POSITIVE,"If you enjoy Thai food, this place is not to be missed."

3988,FOOD#POSITIVE,I felt that they had a huge selection within each area of food that they had.
3989,FOOD#POSITIVE,Part of what makes Serendipity an awesome little spot aside from it's signature frozen hot chocolate (and desserts) is it's cute little charm and that's where this particular Serendipity is lacking.
3990,FOOD#POSITIVE,Delicious food and very large portions!
3991,FOOD#POSITIVE,I love the french cuisine!

3997,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They had pretty interesting gelato flavors though--balsamic fig, chili mango, blood orange and baklava!!"
3998,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Portions are normal and not huge for what you would expect (considering that it's Thai food and for their prices) However, the food is good and they have a decent wine selection."
3999,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food and service was excellent!
4000,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There's an area for Asian cuisine, which things such as dim sum & dumplings, an area for American\/Italian food with stuff such as fried chicken and fries in cute little waffle ice cream cones!"
4001,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The ambiance, food presentation, and selection were promising for our Sunday brunch, but on final taste many of the items at our table were labeled ""okay."""
4002,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Dessert menu was lavish and delicious looking, couldn't help but grab cheesecake, carrot cake, lemon pie, cannoli, flan and tiramisu."
4003,FOOD#POSITIVE,"i ate so much here i literally puked....ya gross, i know lolol

i love the variety of cuisine they offer, and i dont mean just your typical pasta in the italian station, or the fried rice in the asian stations......you seriously have to try this buffet to appreciate it."
4004,FOOD#POSITIVE,Kids ordered hot dogs and foot-long gigantic dogs came out-so they can share.
4005,FOOD#POSITIVE,You could actually share a meal with another person and both be satisfied.
4006,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I would, however, give this place another chance for the food and maybe different flavored drink."
4007,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Very clean, tons of options, nice staff."
4008,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Wine menu is decent also, good choices on French wines at reasonable price."
4009,FOOD#POSITIVE,I'm on the Keto Diet so I am avoiding carbs right now and this had great things for me and everyone else.
4010,FOOD#POSITIVE,"It was a little too crowded for my liking, but still very good food overall."
4011,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Don't order too much, the burgers are quite large."

4016,FOOD#POSITIVE,The Full Montagu: My sister got this one.. and we all agreed that it was our favorite out of the 3...

4027,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Both times I have eaten at Mon Ami Gabi, I have been impressed with the food."
4028,FOOD#POSITIVE,Really big portion.
4029,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Since it is a buffet I will list the memorable items: cream cheese mashed potatoes, truffle pasta, bone marrow, prime rib and ice cream."

4034,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The Asian section is awesome with dimsum, crispy duck and a noodle station."
4035,FOOD#POSITIVE,"My steak au poivre wasn't prepared how I am used to seeing this dish, but it was fantastic nonetheless."
4036,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Not for those with simple tastes, but those with a playful palate will fall in love with the food."
4037,FOOD#POSITIVE,Word of advise I would suggest coming for the weekend dinner over the lunch or breakfast just because the selection is way better.
4038,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Love how they separate the ""hot"" crab legs in a different section which helps with the lines."
4039,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I only got to try the tuna tartar which was delicious, and my cousins were very happy with their choice of the seafood platter."
4040,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Pros:
Great variety
Good desert section
Excellent service (+Very friendly staff!)"
4041,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Aside from the desserts, I liked how there was a charcuterie section because sometimes you just want meat and cheese for dinner."
4042,FOOD#POSITIVE,"You wait way to long for mediocre food, if anything just get the frozen hot chocolate otherwise everything else is a waste!"
4043,FOOD#POSITIVE,"For dinner, there is an even larger selection of cuisine types available."
4044,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food was still great, though."
4045,FOOD#POSITIVE,We had great service and great food in ridiculous portions (luckily I saw some plates so shared a main).
4046,FOOD#POSITIVE,He ended up eating some of my sammy.
4047,FOOD#POSITIVE,The experience is exciting and the food is actually good (compared to buffet food elsewhere).
4048,FOOD#POSITIVE,It's not cheap but I find the quality of the food to be consistently good.
4049,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The best part is the eclectic choice of gourmet burgers that live up to the hype around celebrity chef, Gordon Ramsay ( I do not suppose he is behind the kitchen screaming choicest words at his sous chefs!)."
4050,FOOD#POSITIVE,They also have a gelato bar and tons of miniature desserts.
4051,FOOD#POSITIVE,A great mix of very flavorful and unusual buffet foods.
4052,FOOD#POSITIVE,Food: Euro Burgr- Delish!

4058,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food was good... it was my first time having ratatouille & I ended up liking it.
4059,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They do give out big portions, like big enough for two meals in one plate."
4060,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Lamb chop, pork ribs, beef rib, and especially prime rib (as good as Lawrys) get an A.

Chinese, charcuterie, street tacos, and to a lesser extent, Italian section were all quite good."
4061,FOOD#POSITIVE,"From cake pops, to gelato and upscale mini creations that will surely satisfy any sweet tooth."
4062,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Tasty, unique options on the menu."
4063,FOOD#POSITIVE,Sushi is bomb!
4064,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I had the Farm burger and while it was good, it wasn't anything special."

4067,FOOD#POSITIVE,The portions are HUGE and all the food is delicious.
4068,FOOD#POSITIVE,Selection is decent enough as the quality of food is of what you'd expect for the quality hotel.
4069,FOOD#POSITIVE,They do have a good variety of different food but I guess it just didnt really fit my taste all that much.
4070,FOOD#POSITIVE,I usually go here only for the Frozen Hot Chocolate which is huge and you can share with people.
4071,FOOD#POSITIVE,I have to say I actually liked the milkshake the best of the meal.
4072,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Nothing fancy, just good food."
4073,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed the food, but it was a really rich combo."
4074,FOOD#POSITIVE,Quantity AND quality.
4075,FOOD#POSITIVE,Overall very good quality and worth the premium pricing.
4076,FOOD#POSITIVE,"This buffet was a bit high priced, I mainly went for the seafood offering and the only crab legs I saw being served (hot and cold) were snow crab... at the price they were charging was hoping for a much better selection.. pretty much became an ordinary buffet, though I did get my fill of crab legs."
4077,FOOD#POSITIVE,The amount of food they give is insane!
4078,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Honestly the portions are wayyyyy too big, but it's Vegas, it's what you do."
4079,FOOD#POSITIVE,"A big reason this is as expensive as it is is definitely the seafood section, they have Alaskan king crab, snow carb, etc."
4080,FOOD#POSITIVE,"At dinner, the made-to-order seafood (choice of scampi or bouillabaisse) was probably my favorite thing, followed by the little greek and caprese salads."
4081,FOOD#POSITIVE,Very good food   Try the croque Monsieur    Very good sandwich.
4082,FOOD#POSITIVE,My husband & I thoroughly enjoyed our meal at Burgr and are looking forward to our next visit there.
4083,FOOD#POSITIVE,"-Lots of nuts in food, but they have labels for food allergies!"
4084,FOOD#POSITIVE,"This place is crowded, but it deserves it due to the deliciousness of their sandwiches."
4085,FOOD#POSITIVE,It was a fantastic deal in Vegas...finding GOOD food under $7 at a casino???
4086,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Everybody in our party enjoyed the food, the atmosphere, the company, the whole shebang!"
4087,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Best dish was the Lamb T-Bone hands down, but everything on my plate was devoured."
4088,FOOD#POSITIVE,It was good and different - a place for those who cares about presentations.
4089,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food is very good, the prices fair and the atmosphere can't be beat!"
4090,FOOD#POSITIVE,And they do a good job of catering to the full spectrum of spice lovers.
4091,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Pretty good food, great ice cream but way too expensive, The New York location is so much better."
4092,FOOD#POSITIVE,"You'll be sure to get your fix of salads, charcuterie, sushi, sashimi, meats, seafoods, Asian food, Italian and plenty of desserts."
4093,FOOD#POSITIVE,"We were honest in our opinions, giving the service a C- and the food an A."
4094,FOOD#POSITIVE,My favorite section of the buffet is defiantly the desert section.
4095,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Yeah, it was THAT good!!"
4096,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Hash House is perfect fit for Vegas - oversized, excessive, indulgence but really the experience is just mediocre."
4097,FOOD#POSITIVE,"+Brisket- Great, but I'e pre-determined that Franklins (TX) is the best."
4098,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Awesome selection of food, hip looking seating area, and delicious desserts."
4099,FOOD#POSITIVE,Dinner items are seamlessly swapped out and you get to enjoy all options.
4100,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The variety was was solid, but there were far more misses than hits."
4101,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Presentation wise, the food looked very good."
4102,FOOD#POSITIVE,What a vast array of choices and cuisines.
4103,FOOD#POSITIVE,"My favorite items were the prime rib (because that is always a fave for me), the build your own mac and cheese bar, the individual cheese plates (LOVE!"
4104,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Good eats, quality food and competitive pricing especially when compared to other buffets down the strip."
4105,FOOD#POSITIVE,I would reccomend this place to Yelpers.This is the best review buffet in vegas.The sushi was great the service was great.Pizza tasted good and so did the fish.
4106,FOOD#POSITIVE,The subs are good but only 6-inches and for $6-each... it's a bit pricey.
4107,FOOD#POSITIVE,i remember my sister loving the spinach salad she ordered.
4108,FOOD#POSITIVE,"A wide range of choice of slices of bread, soups."
4109,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Sandwiches here are absolutely fantastic and I'm not a sandwich fan at all, until all my friends that knew if the place told me to go here!"
4110,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I love this place for too many reasons to list but here are a few:

4112,FOOD#POSITIVE,The star of the show are the amazing burgers!
4113,FOOD#POSITIVE,Excellent food selection!
4114,FOOD#POSITIVE,"One last tip = get the brownie ice cream sandwich ($3.29) -- a scoop of ghiradelli vanilla ice cream between 2 HUGE chewy brownies, what a treat and a steal."
4115,FOOD#POSITIVE,We all liked our food.
4116,FOOD#POSITIVE,had great vegan options.
4117,FOOD#POSITIVE,Food was prepared very well and there is so much choice.

4120,FOOD#POSITIVE,It's REALLY good Thai food that doesn't just include Pad Thai and Pad See Ew.
4121,FOOD#POSITIVE,My favorite...the thai tea boba float!
4122,FOOD#POSITIVE,It definitely tasted more like a chocolate shake to me here than it did in NYC though.
4123,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food was exceptional, but honestly, for the price, I don't think it was a good value."
4124,FOOD#POSITIVE,The size of the sandwiches are pretty large we all had some to take with us.
4125,FOOD#POSITIVE,Great food - awesome selection of ingredients - and superb service.
4126,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food was good, not great."
4127,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Not like youre ordinary boring buffet, they have more delicate dishes in small portions that you can take on a small plate, rather than a big blop of food that you scoop up with a big spoon."
4128,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The desserts are delectable, there's a good selection of seafood, but the downside is that the savory foods aren't as flavorful as they look."
4129,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food is good, but really not the main attraction for going there in my opinion!"
4130,FOOD#POSITIVE,Displayed with a lovely biscuit and cucumber dressing - absolutely a delicious and healthy offering!
4131,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I hear only good things about their desserts, which I didn't try, but i dont recommend their food."

4136,FOOD#POSITIVE,I enjoyed the BEST French toast I've ever had along with a variety of other tasty items.
4137,FOOD#POSITIVE,I was expecting   superb customer service since we've been to the one in San Diego and their food and customer service skills was  superb !
4138,FOOD#POSITIVE,"If you want to save some cash and you're in pHo, stop in here and grab one of their delicious sandwiches."
4139,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food I'll go for 2nds, 3rds... even 4ths:
Shrimp Cocktail - jumbo shrimps with cocktail sauce that has a wasabi kick to it
Crab legs - cut in half to make going through plates of them a whole lot faster
Gelato - I tried Pistachio, Coffee and Mango... all great choices, especially with a waffle cone
Chocolate dipped strawberries - triple dipped BIG strawberries
Mousse cones - light and yummy

"
4140,FOOD#POSITIVE,"At wicked spoon, everything is so beautifully presented in individual dishes."
4141,FOOD#POSITIVE,"), and they offer a myriad of desserts to fill your belly."
4142,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Unlike the Eiffel tower restaurant, which serves fancy french food, this is more down home french cooking, the type of stuff you find in a Parisian sidewalk cafe."
4143,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The price is expensive, but you get what you paid for, which is an awesome array of food at a way above average buffet."
4144,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food options go on forever, and if be surprised if someone couldn't find something to drool over."

4147,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Food is great, lots of excellent choices and very friendly service."
4148,FOOD#POSITIVE,Hash House can't do anything small.
4149,FOOD#POSITIVE,The desserts were amazing and I loved the chocolate covered strawberries.
4150,FOOD#POSITIVE,The seafood bar was good except for the oysters.
4151,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There were also 4 or so pastas, a handful of different salads, and other ""asian"" cuisines: char siu, thai seasoned mussels."
4152,FOOD#POSITIVE,"We got there early enough during lunch that they were still making the made-to-order pancakes (regular ones and red velvet), good election of toppings but the actual taste and fluffiness was not what you would expect from a good pancake."
4153,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They had Asaian cuisine like pho, sushi, sweet and sour chicken, beer and broccoli and more."
4154,FOOD#POSITIVE,The desserts are great with a lot of quality selection.

4159,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The salads and fruit options are all fresh and in that same section, freshly carved deli meats are available as well....reminded me much of a charcuterie."
4160,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The main lunch cuisine offerings were breakfast (eggs, toast, etc."
4161,FOOD#POSITIVE,A top notch classy buffet with so many selections it sends your head spinning.
4162,FOOD#POSITIVE,"It was no ""New Orleans Bloody Mary by any stretch"" but it was the best we found in Vegas."
4163,FOOD#POSITIVE,If u are in Las Vegas and want real good food without the formality them definitely try them out.
4164,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Sweets, meats, soups, veggies, and such."
4165,FOOD#POSITIVE,"All other foods (curry, noodles, pork belly) all put happy smiles on our face."
4166,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I loved the variety of dishes, my favorites were the kale salad, the gnocchi, the salmon, and of course the desserts."
4167,FOOD#POSITIVE,The ambiance seating outside was very nice and the food was great.
4168,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I found the sandwich to be a good sandwich, but not the best I have had, especially for the price point (although this was in Vegas, so maybe prices in other locations differ)."
4169,FOOD#POSITIVE,Don't get me wrong the food is pretty good but overpriced due to the popularity and hype.
4170,FOOD#POSITIVE,HUGE portions and way too many choices to make an easy decision on what to order.
4171,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Food:
Chopped Greens & 7 Vegetables (Lunch Menu): had it without the blue cheese, came tossed & with avocado \/ The salad had more content than its name gives it credit for."
4172,FOOD#POSITIVE,Really this place was just decent.
4173,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Onto the buffet,

It has most of the things we've come to expect from a Vegas buffet but very little on the gourmet side."
4174,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Friendly service, nice atmosphere, and some great options for food."
4175,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Now not all of the dishes we ordered were from the Northern Thai portion of the menu that everyone recommended, some were chef's choices others, like the drunken noodle, were personal favorites."
4176,FOOD#POSITIVE,"service was bad... waiter dissappeared and changed to another one without telling us 
food was delicious though... lots of meat cuts, king crabs... etcs
only good dessert that MUST have is creme burlee!!!!"
4177,FOOD#POSITIVE,"All the other foods were okay, but I'm glad the buffet was huge and had lots of diff selections."
4178,FOOD#POSITIVE,"As everyone says, the portions are out of this world."
4179,FOOD#POSITIVE,"From sushi, classic bacon & eggs, parfaits, to croissants - there was so much variety."
4180,FOOD#POSITIVE,Each of the food items was very good.
4181,FOOD#POSITIVE,Loved the unique take on various dishes.
4182,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They had Thai (spring rolls), Korean (bulgogi) and Japanese (sushi) offerings as well."
4183,FOOD#POSITIVE,"As mentioned in previous posts, I agree that the best part of the buffet was dessert."
4184,FOOD#POSITIVE,This keeps for the food looking aesthetically pleasing rather than having someone else wanting to mix the whole tray before they can grab their little corner.
4185,FOOD#POSITIVE,"So then, I figure they couldn't mess up dessert but again I was disappointed, because the presentation looked so good!!!"
4186,FOOD#POSITIVE,My husband ordered the meatloaf sandwich which came with some really good tasting fried.
4187,FOOD#POSITIVE,We all ordered the farm burger because it looked the best.
4188,FOOD#POSITIVE,The Ceasar salad looked better than it tasted.
4189,FOOD#POSITIVE,"After eating at the Wynn, Caesar's Palace, and Bellagio I can honestly say that the food at Wicked Spoon is fresher\/more delicious and the presentation top notch."
4190,FOOD#POSITIVE,I then had some prime rib with bone marrow and a char siu bao (pork bun).
4191,FOOD#POSITIVE,Good thing the breakfast was so huge!!
4192,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The good: 
- we went early for dinner @ 6pm so there was no wait to get in and no long lines (when we left @ 8 pm there was a decent line);
- the ambiance was nice, good floor layout for tables and easy access to the food lines;
- bottled juices - i think fresh squeezed\/juiced and very tasty (my fave was guava, also had strawberry, pineapple, and two or three others) 
- good variety of food to choose from, excellent carved meet selection (prime rib, rack of lamb, two types of sausage) and great seafood selections (oysters on the half shell, cold snow crab, crab claws and hot king crab), standard asian food fair, srandard pizza selection and small pasta area combined with the chef specials."
4193,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There were alot of other varieties, like asian and italian stuff but who is going to eat fried rice and pasta or meat balls at an upscale buffet (oxymoron??)"
4194,FOOD#POSITIVE,Their mac and cheese was insanely good and their gelato selection was huge.
4195,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Awesome food, great service!!!!!!!"
4196,FOOD#POSITIVE,"This is one of the best buffets there is and I have tried lots the variety of food here is so many they have Japanese food Chinese food Vietnamese food Italian food Mexican food American food rib eye turkey , ribs,salads breads crab giant legs and a yummy variety of delicious dessert...."
4197,FOOD#POSITIVE,We decided to split since the portions are so big.
4198,FOOD#POSITIVE,I LOVEEEEEEEED it so much I just wish it was a bigger portion like everything else on the menu.
4199,FOOD#POSITIVE,The salsa and condiment section ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=rHAxXwRiddShZ5mWbyXA4Q ) was extensive with plenty of fresh choices to finish off your tacos.
4200,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Sure, there's enough food and different food options to feed an army of people with different food preferences and interests."
4201,FOOD#POSITIVE,We were so stuffed that we sat in food coma for at least half an hour before leaving the buffet.
4202,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food & service is as good as any 5-star place in Vegas.
4203,FOOD#POSITIVE,"You know how some foods LOOK good, but then they don't TASTE good?"
4204,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I have a huge sweet tooth, and this section went beyond my expectations."
4205,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Although we did go for breakfast, a great deal of their selections could serve as lunch or dinner, depending on your biorythmic status."
4206,FOOD#POSITIVE,Best Thai food I've had in America.
4207,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They do have a salmon breakfast, but it isn't that tasty."
4208,FOOD#POSITIVE,We have gone mostly for ice cream and desserts.
4209,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The prime rib I had at wicked spoon was nicely medium to medium rare, and it was caught thinly enough so I don't have to chew on my meat like im some kind of crazy omnivore."
4210,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Plus, they have all sorts of goodies and treats and good coffee, too."
4211,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The selection of food, desserts, and unlimited mimosas make me want to come back to Vegas just for this place."
4212,FOOD#POSITIVE,I would definitely recommend this restaurant for Brunch on the patio or any meal of the day!
4213,FOOD#POSITIVE,It is a big portion and it's delicious.
4214,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Of course they have your standard breakfast fare as well as such things like: Chicken Marsala w\/mushrooms, sushi; clams and all types of Italian fare."
4215,FOOD#POSITIVE,I ordered the forbidden Broadway ($10) it was enormous !!
4216,FOOD#POSITIVE,"While just a tiny bit smaller and less diverse, the buffet inside The Wynn still carried incredible, top-notch quality buffet food."
4217,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There was ceviche, crab legs, a meat cutter asking how you'd like your meat, and a plethora of desserts!!!"
4218,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Great sandwiches, just wish the prices were not strip prices."
4219,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Great place the burgers and onion rings tasted great.Our server was wonderful,she helped us decide on what certain type of food she liked to eat with her husband..The restaurant was clean..."
4220,FOOD#POSITIVE,"For about $40, you are treated to a truly extensive variety of food."
4221,FOOD#POSITIVE,For quality of food I would still much rather have Wynn Buffet but this is not bad.
4222,FOOD#POSITIVE,"My friends got the ""Caprese"" sandwich and I got the ""Veggie"" sandwich and they were both SO good."
4223,FOOD#POSITIVE,"My favorite at the moment is the Tuna Melt, even though I have to look past how fatty the sandwich is."
4224,FOOD#POSITIVE,"We started out with the Asian food which was good...I was craving sushi which they had, pad Thai, Kung pao chicken and noodles."
4225,FOOD#POSITIVE,The only good thing I can tell about this place - unlimited mimosas!
4226,FOOD#POSITIVE,The desserts here are pretty good for a buffet.
4227,FOOD#POSITIVE,"This place is a must have in Las Vegas, There Sandwiches are amazing."
4228,FOOD#POSITIVE,"High quality and great variety 
High standards and great value"
4229,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Dishes were not as good as they looked, it is more about presentation here."
4230,FOOD#POSITIVE,We were seated near that island and I had been watching the few remaining diners pass by with their beautifully presented single servings.
4231,FOOD#POSITIVE,"$22 for lunch, $29 for dinner so its one of the better bargains for buffets when considering the decent quality."
4232,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I tried to taste ALL that was out, but I failed... there's too much variety within my stomach space and time frame."
4233,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The menu is full of Parisian breakfast fare, and it was difficult to decide what to get."
4234,FOOD#POSITIVE,"It all became somewhat overwhelming after a while, but I'd say the top things to consider: OYSTERS, crab (of course), lamb chops, spicy sausage, sushi, fried chicken."
4235,FOOD#POSITIVE,Many of their dishes are served in individual containers so it's interesting.
4236,FOOD#POSITIVE,- Desserts: not all desserts were good.
4237,FOOD#POSITIVE,"This place is amazing I'm not kidding they have the best shrimp and have the best coconut soup with chicken oh my gosh they have Thai salads there amazing everything is just amazing on that place everything has  good flavor like nothing leaves you out they had like this duck in curry ,chicken or something like that and it was amazing I love it so much please try this place five full stars!"
4238,FOOD#POSITIVE,One of my favorite sandwich places.
4239,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I did enjoy the buffet, found it quite tasty and had a wide range of selection."
4240,FOOD#POSITIVE,Nice size portions that could even be shared.
4241,FOOD#POSITIVE,Great price for a vegas buffet and tons of variety.
4242,FOOD#POSITIVE,"We had the special NYE buffet, which included steamed LOBSTER!"
4243,FOOD#POSITIVE,Drizzle everything with syrup... Yummy yum yum!
4244,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The waiter tried to get me to order it with beef, but that seemed weird so I said chicken."
4245,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Credit where it is due, the chilled seafood platter and desserts we had were very nice."
4246,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Awesome menu selection in food, wine and cocktails."
4247,FOOD#POSITIVE,"You can't go wrong with any of the sandwiches here, especially since they're only $7 and you get full off one."
4248,FOOD#POSITIVE,We were truely spoiled with an abundance of choices.
4249,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Overall, Mon Ami Gabi's food is executed well and visually appealing, but it's really lacking in the little twists and ""Oh!"
4250,FOOD#POSITIVE,"All the standards (peeled shrimp, Alaskan king crab legs, etc) with the addition of traditional Chinese, Italian, BBQ and so much more."
4251,FOOD#POSITIVE,"You can't go wrong with the sundaes and shakes, and the portions are very pleasing."
4252,FOOD#POSITIVE,They have a gelato station which was AMAZING; Super creamy and tons of different flavors.
4253,FOOD#POSITIVE,If you are a asian fusion cusine fan you would love this place.
4254,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Tuna Melt: Let's be honest, fat = flavor, and this sandwich is a saucy mayonnaise tuna-bomb."
4255,FOOD#POSITIVE,"line was down the hall and around the corner and they were still able to seat people withing 20min or less, food was great."
4256,FOOD#POSITIVE,Not to mention their awesome dessert bar with custom made crepes and gourmet cakes and pastries!
4257,FOOD#POSITIVE,"If you're ever out in Vegas and feeling hungry for some bomb food, I would highly suggest you go here."
4258,FOOD#POSITIVE,A for the drink and food presentation.
4259,FOOD#POSITIVE,The drinks are great as well.
4260,FOOD#POSITIVE,Their crab legs are already halved so all it makes eating them super easy.
4261,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They had king crab legs, steak and eggs, hashbrowns, breakfast sausage, spicy chicken mango jabanero sausage, prime rib, ham, pork belly, shrimp and grits, shrimp cocktail, fresh-squeezed juices, lobster pasta, regular pasta, dim sum, chinese food, salads, gellato, chocolate chip cookies, white chocolate macadamia cookies, muffins, apple tarts, and pecan tarts."
4262,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Various flavors of fudge, chocolate dipped strawberries, homemade marshmallows - all good - but nothing could prepare me for the greatness that was the - wait for it - strawberry balsamic gelato."
4263,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Meat lovers, fresh food, deserts love, Best ambience, unlimited king crab legs, lamb, beef, chicken, sea food."
4264,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They have the usual breakfast\/brunch items like eggs benedict, smoked salmon, a salad bar, a variety of juices, and pancakes, waffles, etc."
4265,FOOD#POSITIVE,Portions are huge so if you go with a party of 5 all of you can share a plate.
4266,FOOD#POSITIVE,"This is real deal, gourmet Thai cuisine."
4267,FOOD#POSITIVE,Wish I took some home.
4268,FOOD#POSITIVE,"At all the great Thai restaurants, they all make excellent versions of this dish, and they each have a common trait that says ""this is drunken noodles."""
4269,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The Italian station had these flatbread pizzas that looked like nothing special, but tasted delicious, breakfast items and omelette stations (not just one) were also extremely tasty, pulled pork sliders on corn bread muffins are something you rarely see at a buffet, genius."
4270,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I've always been a buffet type of guy n always want a buffet to have a good set of seafood selection, this place didn't have a good varieties of choices but it was good quality grub.word."
4271,FOOD#POSITIVE,"But for the quality of the food and their offerings, I think the experience is worth it."
4272,FOOD#POSITIVE,"One of my favorite buffets in Vegas....awesome goodness

This place, in my opinon, is BETTER than the Wynn buffet because not only does it offer a wider selection of food, it is also a few bucks cheaper than the Wynn."
4273,FOOD#POSITIVE,Anyway... the food was amazing!
4274,FOOD#POSITIVE,The portion size is good.
4275,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Friday Morning ""Breakfast"" 7:40am I waited 5 mins..The wait at 9:00am when exiting looked like a 10 min wait..Breakfast was 33.52..At 33.52 Do it once and realize you've spent to much on an Over-rated Buffet and move on with Life..With in the Last 10 month's I have tried The Wynn, Wicked Spoon and Bacchanal..I have tried 5 other Strip Buffets also in the past 3 years..And Wicked Spoon is the Best Breakfast Buffet..At Bacchanal, I liked the fried Chicken and the Beef Dish ""Machaca""..Stone Crab was offered Chilled and I tried that for the first time and Liked that also..Everything else was just Ok.."
4276,FOOD#POSITIVE,Great variety of dishes and love how many of them are already proportioned in individual servings so that they're not picked over or more importantly handled by gross possibly sick people.
4277,FOOD#POSITIVE,"It was diner like food, average service and steep prices."
4278,FOOD#POSITIVE,"If you don't mind paying more for arguably the best Thai food in America, then this place is for you."
4279,FOOD#POSITIVE,Their sushi and dim sum was really good I had so many dumplings!
4280,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Andy's Benedict is a huuuuge hot mess of fried chicken, spinach, eggs, biscuits, tomatoes, cheese and bacon but it is soooooo good with a lot of different flavors and textures going on."
4281,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The GF really appreciated the dessert bar, which was wide and varied, and again, lots of tiny bites."
4282,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The selection of food was vast, but the quality of food was poor and full of MSG."
4283,FOOD#POSITIVE,"WS is inside the Cosmopolitan and sets itself apart with contemporary preparations, in many cases, already portioned out in adorable ramekins or mini saucepans."
4284,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The Wicked Spoon, for 27 bucks at the time of writing, has dishes that include truffles, an improbable array of desserts and food variety that was so large, it catered for a group of differently fussy individuals, all of whom were satisfied."
4285,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There is sooo much to choose from here: King crab legs, shrimp cocktail, seabass, salmon, prime rib, lamb, shortribs, Chinese food (chow mein, dim sum, pot stickers), Indian food (naan and curry), bruschetta station (tomato & basil, mushroom, eggplant, etc."
4286,FOOD#POSITIVE,Solid food and a great value considering the location and view.
4287,FOOD#POSITIVE,The presentation was cute though.
4288,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Of course there is great food here, but mostly the great service."
4289,FOOD#POSITIVE,Despite all this Wicked Spoon still managed to impress me with uniqueness and creativity in all their dishes.
4290,FOOD#POSITIVE,"So far, this one is my favorite, the dishes are placed in small containers, which is a nice touch."
4291,FOOD#POSITIVE,The portion was good I cut the burger in half n couldn't finish it like 1\/3 lb burger.
4292,FOOD#POSITIVE,Definitely save room for dessert - there are so many different things you will want to try.
4293,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The amount of food they give you is like ""hungry man"" portions, and value, is well worth every penny!"
4294,FOOD#POSITIVE,"In my opinion the food was good, the venue was excellent, and the service was below par."
4295,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Crab legs are meaty, and you have the choice of either having them cold or steamed depending on your preference."
4296,FOOD#POSITIVE,2) Super extensive menu selection... which is both good and bad.
4297,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Prime rib, game hen, quail, corn flake fried chicken, seafood, pasta... and the list goes on and on."
4298,FOOD#POSITIVE,The beef lasagna was a real winner for me- I kept taking a bite out of everything to not get overly stuffed at a buffet but could not stop myself from going back for a few more bites for the lasagna.
4299,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The second time, I got a free mimosa to start and then the server brought me a second when I looked sad at his refusal to do a refill."
4300,FOOD#POSITIVE,It was pretty delicious.
4301,FOOD#POSITIVE,I would recommend going for an earlier meal to save some money while still getting to enjoy the great variety.
4302,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I had a small portion of everything I wanted and did not have any complaints about the food, which is a really good sign when I eat at buffets."
4303,FOOD#POSITIVE,"We appreciated her honesty, because the portions were HUGE and the chicken and waffles and potatoes were more than enough."
4304,FOOD#POSITIVE,I don't really care for cranberries but I thought it tasted good with this sandwich.
4305,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Overall, the atmosphere is beautiful, and the food was pretty decent."
4306,FOOD#POSITIVE,The frozen hot chocolates are very big and could easily be shared (if we didn't want different flavors).
4307,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food was great, or waiter was fast and friendly."
4308,FOOD#POSITIVE,"You'll find all your typical dishes you would find in any Thai restaurant, there's some pricey specialties aka chef's recommendations at the back of the menu."
4309,FOOD#POSITIVE,"But then you also had great lunch items like the salad bar, gnocchi and freshly cut meats!"
4310,FOOD#POSITIVE,I could not let such good fries go to waste so I finished them up even after my partner gave up.
4311,FOOD#POSITIVE,Presentation was a definitely 5 stars.
4312,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Tons of different foods, all delicious and some exotic."
4313,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They had a lot of options, but I think they fell short on quality, at least for lunch."
4314,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food here is SO WORTH IT.
4315,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food was good and the portions are huge, but this was nothing amazing, particularly not worth the 90 minutes we had to wait for a table."
4316,FOOD#POSITIVE,"nutella bananna), cakes, gelato flavors, candy bar 

The food overall was pretty solid outside of a couple stations, mainly the Chinese and Japanese stations."
4317,FOOD#POSITIVE,Avoid the typical dishes you'd order at a less stellar Thai restaurant and try what these people do best!
4318,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Lots of options,  delicious food."
4319,FOOD#POSITIVE,Try finishing with the lemon creme brulee!
4320,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Virtually no line at 3pm (start for dinner)  I was very impressed by the pre cut crab legs, the plenty tasteful options to overload and diversify your palette, and just overall experience."
4321,FOOD#POSITIVE,If you're are starving and want a gigantic meal come here!!!
4322,FOOD#POSITIVE,It was a HUGE brunch portion - enough for maybe 3 girls.
4323,FOOD#POSITIVE,4 stars for the food minus 1 star for the service.
4324,FOOD#POSITIVE,Yummy food with great presentation!
4325,FOOD#POSITIVE,The desserts are quite good.
4326,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Seafood - Yes, mussels, shrimp, crab, fish
Meats - Yes, chicken, pork, beef, turkey
Vegetables - Yes, salads."
4327,FOOD#POSITIVE,"As with many other buffets here in town, there are salads, breads, different pasta dishes and meats as well as pizzas and asian selections."
4328,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Beef Ribs,  Turkey,  Chinese food,  Primerib , Fried Chicken."
4329,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I have to admit, I was not thrilled about having to eat a sandwich when there are so many other great places to eat in Vegas, but surprisingly, I actually really enjoyed my hot, toasted sandwich!"
4330,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The service was very friendly, and the food and mimosas came out quickly

I went for a very savory option in the seafood crepe, and I didn't know how tasty seafood could be in the morning!"
4331,FOOD#POSITIVE,"prices are super reasonable (about $6 per sandwich), and the selection is huge!"
4332,FOOD#POSITIVE,This place is thee best place to get large portions with little price to pay.
4333,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Presentation of items were nice but lacked in flavor, how can u really go wrong with flan."
4334,FOOD#POSITIVE,You can tell that every station but effort and into their food and it was not rushed.
4335,FOOD#POSITIVE,There is a ton to choose from on the dessert buffet should satisfy any sweet tooth.
4336,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I enjoyed the pancake station were you had three varieties of pancakes to choose from - butter milk ,Blue corn and another variation that I cannot remember."
4337,FOOD#POSITIVE,Every single sandwich is great!
4338,FOOD#POSITIVE,"If you like burgers, (and you should) you gotta stop here!"
4339,FOOD#POSITIVE,I recommend the strawberry balsamic and the nutella.
4340,FOOD#POSITIVE,"American-burgers, pulled pork sandwiches, mac and cheese, chicken and waffles, 4 different kinds of French fries, eggs, bacon, sausage, eggs Benedict, blueberry pancakes and the list goes on...

Asian-dim sum items, fresh sushi, miso soup and if you pay attention, they also serve PHO, yes PHO!!!"
4341,FOOD#POSITIVE,good variety.
4342,FOOD#POSITIVE,It was good bacon but was hickory flavored.
4343,FOOD#POSITIVE,Carving stations were really good and the sushi was good too There is a large Selection of food and desserts ..Wasn't impressed with the pasta tho although I never am at buffets ..
4344,FOOD#POSITIVE,Food choices was amazing and the quality was second to none.
4345,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I recommend Asian people because size of dish is small compared with another restaurant, but it is enough to share with 2 people."
4346,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Yes, they were above average burgers but not to be under Gordon Ramsay's name."
4347,FOOD#POSITIVE,Definitely a must-have for lunch my wife is a humongous fan of Chef Gordon Ramsay and we was not going to leave Las Vegas without having some of his food now we can honestly say I think the man knows what the hell he's doing I'm not a big fan of wings but I honestly got to say those were really good and the burgers were awesome good cut of beef
4348,FOOD#POSITIVE,The quality of food is decent but not comparable to the NYC counterpart.
4349,FOOD#POSITIVE,There was nothing left of that at the end of our meal.
4350,FOOD#POSITIVE,they have great selections of food compared to other places on the strip.
4351,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They do have a lot of great foods including a pasta bar, a pho bar, pizza, meat, sandwiches, and a great dessert line up including gelatos, ice cream, made to order crepes, and cupcakes!"
4352,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food although awesome, was expensive and we were charged for each cup of coffee."
4353,FOOD#POSITIVE,I'm surprised I didn't pass out in a food coma.
4354,FOOD#POSITIVE,"My absolute favorite dish is the white wine seafood soup they prep with your selection of either shrimp, scallops or even mussels!!"
4355,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The display of the food was spectacular, fitting for the high price of over $60 for 2."
4356,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I would have gave this place a 4 for the food and ambiance,  but the service here is poor."
4357,FOOD#POSITIVE,Presentation seemed to have been value engineered.
4358,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Once our food did come out, we all were blown away with just how great each of our dishes were (well except for one person)
My mussels were cooked perfectly, almost all of them had popped open , and the broth was rich extremely flavorful."
4359,FOOD#POSITIVE,Good selection of foods.
4360,FOOD#POSITIVE,Although it's a little known fact that cocktail sauce and cream cheese tastes good together.
4361,FOOD#POSITIVE,Left with food coma... hehe
4362,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Well most of their portions are huge so thing about sharing, or possibly taking some of it home."
4363,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Reasonably priced for the strip, and very good burgers."
4364,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Food is horrible, service and staff are awful."
4365,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Service was quick, the price was A-OK, and you get a pretty darn good sandwich out of it all, so I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas!"
4366,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food here is to die for.
4367,FOOD#POSITIVE,People complain that it is too expensive... but the portion size is completely equivalent to what you pay.
4368,FOOD#POSITIVE,A more refined take on traditional Thai cuisine.
4369,FOOD#POSITIVE,I think that this is the best burger joint in Las Vegas because of the environment and flavor\/taste\/presentation of the food.
4370,FOOD#POSITIVE,I also liked a few of their desserts I thought was different from other buffets like the pandan soba dessert and the jasmine pudding.
4371,FOOD#POSITIVE,"This is a place of super epic portions...our waitress told us this ""added to the fun""!"
4372,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Fresh seafood, sushi, pizza and lots of different dishes to chose from."
4373,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food in general was pretty good.
4374,FOOD#POSITIVE,"If you come here and are overwhelmed by the expansive menu, I would highly recommend being adventurous and ordering mainly off the Northern Thai and Chef's Choice menus."
4375,FOOD#POSITIVE,Tack that on to an absurd amount of offerings and I can definitely be a fan because of the selection.
4376,FOOD#POSITIVE,"However, not all of the food is good."
4377,FOOD#POSITIVE,Dessert: So many choices!
4378,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food is real good and fairly reasonable priced for a LV restaurant.
4379,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Starting out on the appetizers, they have a great selection of salads, cheeses, and cold dishes."
4380,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Every time I thought I got to the last station, I would turn a corner and there would be more food selections."
4381,FOOD#POSITIVE,Start with the great - Dessert station!
4382,FOOD#POSITIVE,Better selection and quality and a cleaner brighter atmosphere.
4383,FOOD#POSITIVE,"She then replied me, ""We have WHATEVER the other restaurants generally have."""
4384,FOOD#POSITIVE,"We started with the warm goat cheese in marinara with pesto garlic bread, it was delicious and so hard to stop eating ."
4385,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Delicious food (great presentation too), friendly service, spectacular seating."
4386,FOOD#POSITIVE,"It has two fried chicken breasts with hardwood smoked bacon waffle tower, hot maple reduction and fried leeks."
4387,FOOD#POSITIVE,There were all sorts of different breakfast foods catering to an international clientele as well as your basic continental breakfast staples.
4388,FOOD#POSITIVE,So my take is:  If you're vegetarian or lactose intolerant... or both... then this is not a great buffet for the price.
4389,FOOD#POSITIVE,"But because we really wanted to try two things, we got the smoked salmon scramble (so yummy, definitely recommended, and oh gosh the strawberry jam that comes with the corn bread) and the fried chicken benefits- ( totally amazing -love their sauce)."
4390,FOOD#POSITIVE,feel like quality has declined... their menu has changed no more meatball =( but still a good option for late night eats still 24\/7
4391,FOOD#POSITIVE,What's great about this buffet is that they have choices that people will eat.
4392,FOOD#POSITIVE,"-Decent seafood variety
-Numerous red meats available."
4393,FOOD#POSITIVE,There wasn't a single item I chose that I didn't like.
4394,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Tonnes of healthy options, $25 at lunch."
4395,FOOD#POSITIVE,Everything was very gourmet and the presentation was on point.
4396,FOOD#POSITIVE,Food is decent but not worth the price.
4397,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The Chefs there have plans to roll out a seasonal menu starting Easter, while continuing to serve the some core items throughout the year, so guests can experience the food at Wicked Spoon without getting bored of the same menu."
4398,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Things I liked out of all dishes was shrimp and grits, breakfast sausage links."
4399,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Portions are big, and they don't scrimp on the food, for example, a seafood dish will definitely have more than just 2 shrimps, unlike some other restaurants."
4400,FOOD#POSITIVE,They had quite a few different stations and a lot of variety.
4401,FOOD#POSITIVE,"This place definitely has the selection but like all buffets, the food is dry and old."
4402,FOOD#POSITIVE,It had a ton of blueberries on top.
4403,FOOD#POSITIVE,A wide variety of quality food including deserts.
4404,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Sure, The Cosmo looks nice and the way the food is presented looks delicious, but it's actually really bland and sometimes stale."
4405,FOOD#POSITIVE,Had the Earl original 1762 sandwich and it was awesome!
4406,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I wish the chicken slider came in a full sized burger portion, because it would make for a great entree."
4407,FOOD#POSITIVE,The salads are ok. Not the best but better than Subway.
4408,FOOD#POSITIVE,Great Thai food at a great price - I love to bring friends here.
4409,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Overall, the meal was fantastic and I would highly recommend eating here!"
4410,FOOD#POSITIVE,"For vegetarians,  there are plenty of choices here."
4411,FOOD#POSITIVE,The ice cream sandwich - what a perfect way to end your meal.
4412,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food selection is awesome.
4413,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Dress Code: casual

Menu options: seafood, meat station, american, mexican, asian."
4414,FOOD#POSITIVE,The wide range of international cuisine to the most finicky eater.
4415,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They offer sliced Alaskan King Crab legs, jumbo shrimp, sushi, homemade pasta station, fresh soups, Seabass, Swordfish, Lamb, Prime Rib, Euro imported cheeses, Brick oven pizzas, tasty desserts, etc."
4416,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I didn't get close to trying everything, but the items i did try were decent, especially by buffet standards."
4417,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Stir fry, Mediterranean spreads, bread selection, sliders, sides, fried chicken, tamales, carne asada?"
4418,FOOD#POSITIVE,And their best part is their dessert station.
4419,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food choice is smaller than the Bellagio, but the food is better."
4420,FOOD#POSITIVE,The dessert section was awesome never got around too trying the gelato.
4421,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Excellent selection of food from seafood, American , Chinese,  and much much more."
4422,FOOD#POSITIVE,- Sweet Potato Fries with honey jalapeno mayo: One of my favorite things to eat here.
4423,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Great selection, quality foods and very clean\/well put together inside."
4424,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There is an extensive variety of food, and the ice cream station is extraordinary!"
4425,FOOD#POSITIVE,I knocked it down two stars because the flavor has been knocked down to fit farang palates and the service is stoic and unfriendly.
4426,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Food is kept in stock virtually across the spectrum of options constantly, which is impressive, and the overall atmosphere is classy without making you feel out of place wearing a tank top (which I was... don't ask)."
4427,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, Earl of Sandwich located inside Planet Hollywood, offers amazing sandwiches at winning prices."
4428,FOOD#POSITIVE,"came here after--surprise surprise--a night of liquidation, and couldn't have found a better place for food."
4429,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Fantastic meal in Vegas, I much appreciated their toasted GF bread (still trying to figure out where they source this, it actually taste like bread!)"
4430,FOOD#POSITIVE,I could not finish the salad because the portion was huge which is why I think the 17 dollar price tag was fair and the tuna was so good!
4431,FOOD#POSITIVE,Most of the dishes I tried can be easily compared to high end restaurants food on  quality & taste.
4432,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Good food, and friendly but slow service."
4433,FOOD#POSITIVE,You could easily share plates here!
4434,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Surprisingly, this buffet's seafood selection was close to awesome."
4435,FOOD#POSITIVE,"My boyfriend excitedly filled his plate with the selections from the meat-carving station only to find out that most of the lamb chop had been fat and it was underwhelming, despite the grand presentation."
4436,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Now about the buffet...
Again I love that for the most part they pre-portion food, so it ""grab and move along""."
4437,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Their salad bar is quite good, but I'm not at a buffet for salad."
4438,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Like other buffets, Caesars had a variety of different cuisines: Asian, American, Mexican, Italian and of course dessert!"
4439,FOOD#POSITIVE,Some dishes were absolutely divine - roast beef (best ever!)
4440,FOOD#POSITIVE,It is a big place and amazing food.
4441,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Anyway...the food selection is great, but one would have to walk his\/her way to the food section."
4442,FOOD#POSITIVE,I  wasn't disappointed in the food though.
4443,FOOD#POSITIVE,"We ALL were in awe of the selection, quality and quantity."
4444,FOOD#POSITIVE,Beautiful Presentation of food that will leave you breathtaken by it!
4445,FOOD#POSITIVE,"As you'd expect, both portions were huge."
4446,FOOD#POSITIVE,Overall they have a wide range of food selections.
4447,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Great food, great service, and if you can catch a spot on the balcony great people watching."
4448,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They had tons of different options like Italian, Asian, American etc."
4449,FOOD#POSITIVE,Desserts included a Gelato bar and cepe station as well as a nice selection of cakes and other treats.
4450,FOOD#POSITIVE,"If you're looking for a quality cheap sandwich in Vegas, Earl of Sandwich is a great choice."
4451,FOOD#POSITIVE,"You will also love the beer selection..lots of unusual, not the run of the mill choices."
4452,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food it really good.
4453,FOOD#POSITIVE,The crab legs are cut in halves so you to work like a slave to please your seafood fix or Asian fix to eat more of the expensive foods to feel like you got more for your $$$!
4454,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Dessert was okay due to large selection, but still not as tasty as I had hoped."
4455,FOOD#POSITIVE,Alos the ways they present the food were cool and small enough to give you a decent taste but not gorge on that particular thing.
4456,FOOD#POSITIVE,I had so much food so I cant really specify what I had.
4457,FOOD#POSITIVE,"(We call it that because you have Thai, Korean, American and Mexican themed restaurants and businesses all in one place)."
4458,FOOD#POSITIVE,While the service and food was amazing!
4459,FOOD#POSITIVE,The menu had what seems like hundreds of various options that I've never even seen on a Thai menu.
4460,FOOD#POSITIVE,"And most of all, the food was SOOOOO GOOOOOD."
4461,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I'm not sure how much they change up the buffet here since this was my first time, but we came here for lunch and wow the spread was impressive."
4462,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Gordon Ramsey I am scared of you, but I will continue to eat at your place and gulp down your food."
4463,FOOD#POSITIVE,Most notable is all the seafood offered and prepared in various ways and they had a ramen and pho station.
4464,FOOD#POSITIVE,"But, the bacon balsamic sorbet was a definite repeat."
4465,FOOD#POSITIVE,Oysters was fresh and a great variety of food.
4466,FOOD#POSITIVE,So much food!!
4467,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Great food, good service, and the very best 
place for people- and fountain-watching on the strip."
4468,FOOD#POSITIVE,I had their French toast which was amazingly good.
4469,FOOD#POSITIVE,I like how they serve the food in small portions so you can try a lot of different food.
4470,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Wait time was crazy, crazy long, but we enjoyed our food (it was almost noon and we hadn't had breakfast yet) and bloody marys, although they could've used a bit more spice."
4471,FOOD#POSITIVE,I must say it's a damn good place for romantic dinners..the ambiance is quite classy and beautiful..the waiters were very friendly......the french onion soup and the scallops entree were good...........the only minimal complaint i have is it's a bit pricey...........we finished off with a White Chocolate Bread pudding dessert which topped all the items of our dinner....I sure recommend this place for romantic dinners at least :)
4472,FOOD#POSITIVE,"If you're wowed by over the top presentation and foods that will make you instantly gain 10lbs at the table, Hash Hash is for you!"
4473,FOOD#POSITIVE,The corn beef hash was really good and paired so well with the runny egg yolk!
4474,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I didn't like the soy sauce syrup, more of a traditional syrup guy myself, but this place sure did do the trick for the fried chicken craving."
4475,FOOD#POSITIVE,You don't feel like you've wasted any food.
4476,FOOD#POSITIVE,ATTENTION VEGETARIANS this is by far the best option for buffets that Vegetarians and Vegans have.
4477,FOOD#POSITIVE,I like that this place serve Northern Thai food which I like and there's a lot of dishes I want to try.
4478,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I do love their presentation of the food items, however, I think they should really work on the taste of their food before presentation."
4479,FOOD#POSITIVE,"-They have a mini-bakery section with different breads like white, sourdough, wheat."
4480,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Nice atmosphere, food was not bad at all, and the champagne was flowing like nobody's business."
4481,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food was great, they had a wide variety of choices and they were very quick on filling up the plates as they were emptying very fast."
4482,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Overall, the food was good as expected."
4483,FOOD#POSITIVE,I now dream about the chicken and waffles from Hash House A Go Go!
4484,FOOD#POSITIVE,"This is the best Thai food in Las Vegas, and maybe the best Thai food in America."
4485,FOOD#POSITIVE,Bottomless mimosas were great and our server kept filling us up.
4486,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I love that it's so tasty, but I hate that there are no locations in OC."
4487,FOOD#POSITIVE,A lot of food.
4488,FOOD#POSITIVE,I was going to order something else and my server talked me into the sage chicken bend- omg!!!
4489,FOOD#POSITIVE,I thought that their food was very unique and it was all good quality.
4490,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Yes there is a ""caviar"" bar but just know it is not real caviar, but still tasty."
4491,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Sandwiches here are about $7 and although it makes a good late night snack, it's nothing I would schedule in my Vegas food itinerary."
4492,FOOD#POSITIVE,"i discovered that if you go around 3:30, you will have a selection of both lunch and dinner for the lunch price."
4493,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There's also a very large variety and the buffet is split into different sections - American, Asian, Italian, seafood, and a whole section dedicated to just desserts!"
4494,FOOD#POSITIVE,It's annoying that the wait can be long and I really don't like the seating options they have - but the food is so amazing.
4495,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The juices are fresher the desserts are better, the menu is more unique and even the presentation is just better."
4496,FOOD#POSITIVE,"My favorite dishes were the prime rib, the pastas, and the side salad."
4497,FOOD#POSITIVE,The desserts were plentiful and tasty.
4498,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Good food, but easily enough to split."
4499,FOOD#POSITIVE,Desserts were also fantastic.
4500,FOOD#POSITIVE,"To our surprise, every single food items were great."
4501,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Normally at buffets you portion sizes are so big you can't really just try a lot of different items, but here they are very reasonably sized so we could try something and not feel bad if we didn't eat it all."
4502,FOOD#POSITIVE,I grabbed a variety of desserts after walking around the station and tried a sample of each one.
4503,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The Buffet at the Wynn (delicious, wide variety, awesome atmosphere but price point is high and the wait can be ridiculous)

4."
4504,FOOD#POSITIVE,"He had a great grasp on the extensive wine list (We ordered a bottle, and he confirmed to see if we knew what it was we were ordering...we did, but nice that he checked) and gave great recommendations so we could share dishes and have everything still pair nicely with the German Riesling."
4505,FOOD#POSITIVE,Had a Caprese Sandwich on wheat (which was recommended by an employee there) and a side of Mac and Cheese... and my son had a turkey sandwich with all if the Thanksgiving fixings on it... the food was so good.
4506,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Great food and great service, the pricing is not nearly as high as you would expect for the view, ambiance and the fact that it's right on the strip."
4507,FOOD#POSITIVE,"All the other dishes ordered in the 2 consecutive days that we went (mac 'n cheese, ""one-eyed"" jack, footlong hot dog with condiments, sweet potato fries, coleslaw) were pretty solid."
4508,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They also have a cheap lunch buffet with Pad Thai, a curry, a few other dishes and one of my favorite dishes there, the Garlic Wings."
4509,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Other pros: I ate tons of cocktail shrimp (they came in twos), the tartare (I think it was veal) in a cone appetizer was amazing

Others cons: sushi selection was poor, dessert selection was pretty bland aside from the ice-cream, asian section wasn't even worth existing."
4510,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Unlimited mimosas for brunch on the weekends, lunch serves a lot of the same things as dinner, but dinner sometimes offers more seafood."
4511,FOOD#POSITIVE,But the food was great and we will be back.
4512,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food was good, but not great."
4513,FOOD#POSITIVE,The burgers and fries are very tasty!
4514,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Ambiance\/cleanliness\/service: 4.5
Everything was beautifully served, small plates, clean setting."
4515,FOOD#POSITIVE,A nice spread of choices.
4516,FOOD#POSITIVE,The crepes were wonderfully prepared and were a great finish to my buffet.
4517,FOOD#POSITIVE,8 italian premium cold cuts.
4518,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I'm not gonna lie, the food is amazing here, and different from typical buffet food."
4519,FOOD#POSITIVE,The pho was good for a buffet too.
4520,FOOD#POSITIVE,They always have a good fruit selection.
4521,FOOD#POSITIVE,There is no way the normal person is going to eat it all- and its unlikely that you will be taking home leftovers in Vegas if you're staying at a nice hotel.
4522,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food was very tasty and reasonably portioned.
4523,FOOD#POSITIVE,The mug was huge and the tea bag was really cool and something that I don't think they have in stores in NY-very organic.
4524,FOOD#POSITIVE,"This is a place that not only serves good food, but also offers one of the best places to watch Vegas."
4525,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There aren't mounds of food, the food is plated in individual pots\/bowls or if on a big dish, pleasantly placed."
4526,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The good thing about this buffet though is that, there is so much food, you can find something you like."
4527,FOOD#POSITIVE,is it the best thai food i've ever had?
4528,FOOD#POSITIVE,The best escargot I have had in a very long time tender not rubbery nice garlic herb butter AWESOME.
4529,FOOD#POSITIVE,You can smell the yummy truffles the moment you step foot into the restaurant!
4530,FOOD#POSITIVE,They take ordinary menu items and pair them with interesting ingredients you would never think of trying.
4531,FOOD#POSITIVE,On to the food: I never miss out on their filet mignon with merlot butter.
4532,FOOD#POSITIVE,"07\/06\/10

Sure, Mon Ami Gabi serves mostly tourists, but the service and their food was phenomenal."
4533,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The bright side, the dessert are actually quite decent, so if you're into sweets, you would love the buffet more than I did."
4534,FOOD#POSITIVE,"While the food was decent, the price cannot be justified for how mediocre majority of the stuff offered on the buffet."
4535,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Other than that, the food is really good."
4536,FOOD#POSITIVE,"For the large variety of food available, and in comparison to other restaurants on the Strip, I found it worth it."
4537,FOOD#POSITIVE,The sandwiches are neatly wrapped.
4538,FOOD#POSITIVE,This place has some of the best buffet food you can realistically ask for.
4539,FOOD#POSITIVE,"went for brunch

only good thing about this buffet is that its $22 and comes with one free mamosa or champage, or bloody marie, if you're into that

presentation was very nice and creative, but it was very depressing to finally bite into the food and realize it didn't taste good."
4540,FOOD#POSITIVE,Lovely presentation.
4541,FOOD#POSITIVE,I temporarily quit a year long keto diet for this place.
4542,FOOD#POSITIVE,The variety and individual portions and attention to detail and quality makes this buffet stand out from the rest.
4543,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Lunch, dinner, drunk, hungover, etc etc, Earl's is open 24 hours and the food is AMAZING each and every time."
4544,FOOD#POSITIVE,They have a variety of foods that range from spaghetti and meatballs to barbecued pork ribs.
4545,FOOD#POSITIVE,My god they make the best club sandwiches!
4546,FOOD#POSITIVE,Love love love the decor and food presentation.
4547,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Too much to choose from, as always at a buffet, but still good food to help your hangover headache."
4548,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I'm not going to each and ever food because everything was truly great but its the little things about the place that all add up to excellence in the end, not to mention my waitress was very generous with my drinks always making sure I had a full glass and some to-go as well!"
4549,FOOD#POSITIVE,Their shrimp cocktail is noticeably larger than any other place I've been.
4550,FOOD#POSITIVE,I recommend you order some orange juice and make mimosas.
4551,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food display was really pleasant to, good for those Instagram pics!"
4552,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Passed up the rest of the store looking sushi, stir-frys, and salads...again, familiar stuff like all the other buffets, nothing to set themselves apart, no wow factor, nada....

DESSERTS-Lots of eye candy with the spread here...Favorites were the Baklava Ice Cream, and the simplicity of a warm crepe made to order."
4553,FOOD#POSITIVE,"With that said, you can probably get the serving size for one and split it between 2 people (unless you want one all to yourself)."
4554,FOOD#POSITIVE,"BTW, the presentation of the food was so adorable!"
4555,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Bacchanal is more focused on the large variety of food selection, but totally lacking in taste."
4556,FOOD#POSITIVE,I felt their desserts were lacking a bit though but the seafood was really delicious and fresh.
4557,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food the presentation is beautiful.
4558,FOOD#POSITIVE,The buffet was not cheap but between the amazing food and my endless bloody mary's it was worth every penny.
4559,FOOD#POSITIVE,It's as good as dinner but dinner I think you get seafood and other expansive dishes.
4560,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I agree with the other Yelpers - dessert bar amazing, great variety of cuisines represented,  and awesome presentations and nicely portioned out for single servings."
4561,FOOD#POSITIVE,"An order of the kid's chicken strips ($8.95) come 3 per order with a honey mustard sauce and ranch, along with carrot and celery sticks that my son avoided like the plague."
4562,FOOD#POSITIVE,The changing Gelato offerings were quite good.
4563,FOOD#POSITIVE,It's the BEST tomato bisque I've ever tasted.
4564,FOOD#POSITIVE,What a fun place to grab an awesome burger!
4565,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The combination of great service, fun environment, and great food that is unique leads me to say that's BurGR deserves 5 STARS!!!!"
4566,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I have been to this buffet tons of times when I would visit vegas, and even when I lived there for a little while, great selection, and everything actually tastes good."
4567,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The two things that stood out in my mind were the Asian station, which was celebrating Chinese New Year, and the dessert station."
4568,FOOD#POSITIVE,"the good:
- really cute presentation: i did love how MOST things are portioned out into really cute containers."
4569,FOOD#POSITIVE,Most of the selections at the Bellagio Buffet are unique.
4570,FOOD#POSITIVE,"YAASSSSS, and the food is phenomenal."
4571,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Good spread, great service (our coffee was refilled multiple times without request) and pretty good selection."
4572,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The bun was soft (like fast food), the patty was soft, avocado was soft, and the additional dressings were soft, I think you see the trend here....

For a place that is supposed to be all about the burger that is what I enjoyed the least."
4573,FOOD#POSITIVE,Let me tell you the heat lamps or boiling water under the food that must not have been working.
4574,FOOD#POSITIVE,"haha 

The food is authentic and amazing."
4575,FOOD#POSITIVE,They have a HUGE selection of food choices and they taste good !
4576,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Awesome place, portions were huge (which is their selling point) and awesome service."
4577,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The buffet also has sushi, seafood, salad, and all kinds of other food that I either don't eat or didn't have room for."
4578,FOOD#POSITIVE,"And given that this is Vegas, the portions are pretty good for the $."
4579,FOOD#POSITIVE,Great selection of dinner food and desserts.
4580,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They have a wide variety of food, and the presentation of it is all great."
4581,FOOD#POSITIVE,Food selection @ Bacchanal was very vast.
4582,FOOD#POSITIVE,I'm such a fan and it's the simple foods that show how they get it right.
4583,FOOD#POSITIVE,Why waste room in your stomach though when there's ALL that food?!
4584,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Great food, service, and best people watching!"
4585,FOOD#POSITIVE,I had never been to a buffet this big in my life.
4586,FOOD#POSITIVE,"We re-ordered it the second day, and subsequently purchased the elegant carafe off Amazon."
4587,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food was really good!
4588,FOOD#POSITIVE,All the dishes were great.
4589,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Basically, the food looks great but tastes underwhelming and disappointing for its price - any other $50 buffet would be better (i.e."
4590,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The restaurant decor was really pretty, and the dishes that were already in individual servings (served in cute mini pots and pans!)"
4591,FOOD#POSITIVE,Love the sandwiches at The Earl!
4592,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The breakfast was pretty standard, lots of American options: waffles, omelets, oatmeal, fruit, etc."
4593,FOOD#POSITIVE,"If anything, I think it was the burger meat - all the add ons and condiments saved this burger."
4594,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Good food, good service and a lot of fun."
4595,FOOD#POSITIVE,There was a very large selection and some things were good but nothing stood out as being stellar.
4596,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Also - I'm not a crab leg person as I'm allergic, but the giant snow crab (or alaskan king crab legs) were very popular - I even saw one tiny lady pack a plate high with at least 25."
4597,FOOD#POSITIVE,But I actually tried 4 plates worth of food.
4598,FOOD#POSITIVE,"For instance, they have sushi, carving station, seafood (no crab legs for brunch), omelette station, and many more."
4599,FOOD#POSITIVE,The toasted bread and taste of the sandwich make for a good meal.
4600,FOOD#POSITIVE,The selections are quite creative as well in contrast to most standard run-of-the-mill buffets.
4601,FOOD#POSITIVE,They've got all kinds of food and the best part about it is the quality of the food.
4602,FOOD#POSITIVE,Most items are made in small batches to maintain quality and freshness.
4603,FOOD#POSITIVE,Large selection of food from all types of cuisines... endless dessert bar as well!
4604,FOOD#POSITIVE,Hardest decision was knowing what to order from their 10 page menu.
4605,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Their seafood crepe, chic liver pate and sandwiches are good too, along with their real potato fries!"
4606,FOOD#POSITIVE,Huge variety of food..worth the price....there is everything you can imagine!
4607,FOOD#POSITIVE,My favorite is the presentation and the cleanliness.
4608,FOOD#POSITIVE,Great food and decent service.
4609,FOOD#POSITIVE,Probably all the sandwiches are good here.
4610,FOOD#POSITIVE,If your in Vegas and you like burgers go here even if you don't like burgers go =)
4611,FOOD#POSITIVE,Disappointed in the selection of the food (very little for a buffet) but everything tasted great!
4612,FOOD#POSITIVE,Dessert were the best part.
4613,FOOD#POSITIVE,"It's great how they thought of controlling the portions, because we all know how so many people waste tons of food at buffets."
4614,FOOD#POSITIVE,"This place has a strangely mid-western gourmet take on breakfast, portions are huge and quality is right up there with the diners from Indiana to Topeka."
4615,FOOD#POSITIVE,"This was not my issue at all, it was the food."
4616,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Some personal favorites of mine include the onion soup, filet mignon merlot, and the profiteroles!!"
4617,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Pretty decor, and wide selection of foods but food quality and taste is average.."
4618,FOOD#POSITIVE,I just told my bf about this place again yesterday because we are heading back to Vegas soon and I want that damn steak wine reduction meal in my belly again.
4619,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Pros: A monster selection of different types of foods ranging from BBQ, Italian, American, Asian, and more."
4620,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food was awesome and the portions were huge.
4621,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Quick service...cocktails were super fun, dessert chocolate mousse and profiteroles amazing...steak succulent and done perfectly, appetizers were OHHHHH good, and the WARM BAGUETTES OF BREAD delivered to your table 3 at a time?????"
4622,FOOD#POSITIVE,The bread is divine; I seriously would take boatloads and smuggle it home w me.
4623,FOOD#POSITIVE,There was still plenty of variety in foods.
4624,FOOD#POSITIVE,"It had all the usual excess of any Vegas buffet, but everything was amped up to a whole new level of quality."
4625,FOOD#POSITIVE,Great service and amazing food make the 1 hr wait so worth it.
4626,FOOD#POSITIVE,I also love the WAFFLE FRIES!
4627,FOOD#POSITIVE,Lots of there food actually do run low so it's a good sign - some buffets have food that sits there for a while but I didn't see that happening here.
4628,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food comes in SUPER LARGE portions, so sharing could definitely be an option if you don't eat too much."
4629,FOOD#POSITIVE,Ok..this place has some crazy burger ideas.
4630,FOOD#POSITIVE,I'm not sure if you can find a bigger variety and line of food anywhere else in Vegas.
4631,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The best things were the roasted chicken, crab, tacos, and the mashed potatoes."
4632,FOOD#POSITIVE,This is a plentiful meal with unlimited food options and you can easily eat yourself into a food coma.
4633,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Loved the food, had the Farm BurGR."
4634,FOOD#POSITIVE,My friends must've gotten full off just that!
4635,FOOD#POSITIVE,At least we had a great selection of food instead of going to a prefixe dinner for more than that for New Year's Eve in Vegas.
4636,FOOD#POSITIVE,Great meal.
4637,FOOD#POSITIVE,"In Vegas, I know I'm gonna spend  and lose a lot of money because i'm a terrible gambler since slot machines are so hypnotizing and i'm the unluckiest person you would ever meet, so this sandwich helped me stay fed in Vegas - its very affordable, especially by Las Vegas standards."
4638,FOOD#POSITIVE,"As some other reviewers have mentioned, the location isn't the best, but the food definitely makes up for it."
4639,FOOD#POSITIVE,YOU have to make sure you get steam rice w\/ this(order separately)  or else you're not doing this dish justice.
4640,FOOD#POSITIVE,I enjoyed my night eating a wide array of food- but mostly munching on crackers and brie with the wine.
4641,FOOD#POSITIVE,"After dining here, my general comments are: yes, there is a ton of food choices around varying from Chinese, Italian, Meats, Seafood, Cheeses, Japanese and even dim sum items, but the quality of the food tasted average."
4642,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I thought it might be those frenchy restaurants where food looks pretty but they hardly serve you food; well, nooooo, food looks, pretty, tastes amazing and it's worth the price."
4643,FOOD#POSITIVE,There is even a Udon\/Ramen section where the chef will make whatever you like right on the spot and you can add the toppings on your own.
4644,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The restaurant features a fairly large menu selection, some are common and easy to find on other menus, but more importantly it has entrées and specials that are not available in most other Thai restaurants in the US."
4645,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Compared to the other top buffets, it might not beat Wynn in terms of taste or quality but I think the way they have it set up, especially with food prepped right in front of you, and the variety makes it the best buffet in Vegas."
4646,FOOD#POSITIVE,"This isn't to say that the number of offerings has diminished or the quality has gone down, although I will point out that the custom mac and cheese station now has far fewer choices and desserts seem to have more duplication across the space than before."
4647,FOOD#POSITIVE,I wouldn't mind ordering most of the dishes again.
4648,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There is also a huge health nut selection, including crazy fresh juice infusions."
4649,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There's no need to do a ton of research here, if you're an expert of this region of Thailand's cuisine,  you'll know what to try."
4650,FOOD#POSITIVE,There was definitely some changes to the buffet...the selections were somewhat different (what a nice surprise!).
4651,FOOD#POSITIVE,"While most were too sweet for myself, they were still yummy and I would go for them again."
4652,FOOD#POSITIVE,Entrees are varied with non beef dishes nicely done as well.
4653,FOOD#POSITIVE,I wish I could have tried everything but I was on the verge of a food coma.
4654,FOOD#POSITIVE,I got black sesame flavor and I prayed that I had a separate stomach just so I could have more.
4655,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Even with the plethora of options for a quality burger in Vegas, Gordon Ramsey BurGR proves itself as a top choice for me."
4656,FOOD#POSITIVE,The dessert area is also impressive with lots of high quality choices.
4657,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Amazing food at this place, and a huge wine selection."
4658,FOOD#POSITIVE,One dish was actually big enough for the two of us and I will definitely be back!
4659,FOOD#POSITIVE,Great food and a ton of it.
4660,FOOD#POSITIVE,Presentations are nice and simple..contemporary but the food was just ok.
4661,FOOD#POSITIVE,Quite a wide selection of good food.
4662,FOOD#POSITIVE,All food portions were HUGE but the Benedict was crazy large and packed with flavor on every bite.
4663,FOOD#POSITIVE,Dessert selection was impressive and delicious
4664,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food selection was plentiful, if you can't find something to eat given all the choices there's something wrong with you."
4665,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Still happy with food, so many choices as usual, but not much taste, Bellagio buffet still has best flavors overall."
4666,FOOD#POSITIVE,A significant amount of the food items offered were on the salty side.
4667,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food was perfectly seasoned and everything was quite fresh.
4668,FOOD#POSITIVE,Love this restaurant for not only the excellent food but also the view from their patio.
4669,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There are tons of delicious choices and selections here, and I love the variety of food."
4670,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Just call, take the late night reservation time, and enjoy the food."
4671,FOOD#POSITIVE,My favorite part of the meal was the truffle fries.
4672,FOOD#POSITIVE,The carving station was particularly impressive.
4673,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Its bad, I know, I have to order 3 sandwiches everytime!"
4674,FOOD#POSITIVE,"You should try their burger, the best in Vegas, they got more and more types of burgers  , and the service was really good especially the manager Zac."
4675,FOOD#POSITIVE,"My sister ordered the steel cut oatmeal with fruit, and as beautiful as it looked, it was poorly executed."
4676,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Food-wise, Wicket Spoon has the typical potpourri of carvery meats, seafood options, asian-themed foods (i really can't recommend asian foods @ non-asian restaurants, it never tastes ""right""), and then of course a sumptuous dessert bar."
4677,FOOD#POSITIVE,Too many good choices on Vegas to come here!
4678,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The fries were great, but give a thought to the dipping sauces as some of the combinations get a little funky."
4679,FOOD#POSITIVE,I love this sandwich and it is definitely my go-to.
4680,FOOD#POSITIVE,I've tried a few of the burgers and my favorite by far is the Euro burger.
4681,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The portion of the food is ridiculously big, but in a good way!!"
4682,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Not only does the food look good, much of it tastes good."
4683,FOOD#POSITIVE,The Fresh smoked bacon was something.
4684,FOOD#POSITIVE,Everything you'd want in a homemade corned beef hash.
4685,FOOD#POSITIVE,The garlic prawns alone are worth the trip off the strip!
4686,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Some fantastically original offerings...some standard Ponderosa\/OCB offerings...mainly mouthwatering, and more less worth the $53 check and 45 minute wait."
4687,FOOD#POSITIVE,"It's around $65 for weekend dinner buffet (that price included tax and 18% gratuity for my 8+ party), but they have such a vast variety of the food and wonderful presentation for each of the dishes that the price doesn't stop me from wanting to go back even as I'm writing this review."
4688,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food here is very good and the portion size borders on the ridiculous as plates are extra large to accommodate the amount of food served.
4689,FOOD#POSITIVE,I am a huge fan of the dessert section here and would argue that it was the best among all the buffets I visited on this particular trip (compared to the Caesars and Wynn buffets).
4690,FOOD#POSITIVE,Its an expansive buffet with tons of options.
4691,FOOD#POSITIVE,Really good but the portions are ridiculously huge.
4692,FOOD#POSITIVE,"- Lobster chowder
- Lamb chop: At first I didn't see it at the carving station, because it was put behind the sausages, but once I found it, it quickly became my favorite meat!"
4693,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I had the Sage Chicken Benny, or thought I did... the first time they brought it out without the chicken... presentation was nice and flavors were great."
4694,FOOD#POSITIVE,I would classify it as a must stop place just to try that one drink.
4695,FOOD#POSITIVE,I could definitely finish one all by myself since it's so darn delicious!
4696,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I really like how some of the food, such as the pasta were already placed in cute little dishes for you to grab."
4697,FOOD#POSITIVE,"As for the food, I get that they have a great selection but I don't think it's any better than most other Vegas buffets."
4698,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They have wide variety of dishes, all priced at $49.99."
4699,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Overall, fantastique food in decent portions & good prices, visually stunning and beautiful french vibe."
4700,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I'll admit - this is my first Vegas buffet, but damn, everything I put into my mouth was amazing."
4701,FOOD#POSITIVE,Its awesome that you can order food from a deli in a Vegas hotel and the sandwiches start from $5.99... Their sandwiches are yummmy too!!
4702,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Example, small pieces of golden friend chicken served in a little metal basket not only controls the portion, it also saves me plenty of room to sample everything else I've been eyeing."
4703,FOOD#POSITIVE,The dessert bar was in a separate room and it looked fantastic.
4704,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food is pretty good here, I think it's something I would go to once but don't think I'd go back again just because there are a ton of other good buffets in vegas too!"
4705,FOOD#POSITIVE,The customer service is also great and the selection of food is awesome.
4706,FOOD#POSITIVE,"After getting what I wanted which all ended up on 3 separate plates, it was just hard to figure out where to start!"
4707,FOOD#POSITIVE,The salmon was delicious and the toast was constantly replaced so nice and crunchy on the outside\/soft on the inside.
4708,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The crepe batter they use yields a nice thin, slightly chewy crepe."
4709,FOOD#POSITIVE,Earl of Sandwich gets you in and out quick with great prices and excellent food.
4710,FOOD#POSITIVE,"We ordered a lot, even though we were very aware of large portions this place was famous for."
4711,FOOD#POSITIVE,Certain dishes in particular are far above what I would think possible for a buffet.
4712,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The selection is wide in terms of genre (seafood, American, Asian, Italian, Mexican, Dessert) but with the exception of the dessert table, the options available were all pretty basic."
4713,FOOD#POSITIVE,There were so many options to choose from.
4714,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I had the seafood crepe for about $16 and although it wasn't the best crepe I've ever had, the sauce and the fresh-tasting shrimps\/scallops were solid along with a cranberry juice (they had a full drink bar\/menu of a lot of items)."
4715,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food was delish, service always came quickly with a joke or a smile, and the portions are unbelievably HUGE!!"
4716,FOOD#POSITIVE,It was so elegant inside & the food was amazing!
4717,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Place was ok, burgers were good it's in Vegas and has a famous chefs name involved so it was packed and there were lines."
4718,FOOD#POSITIVE,It's so good that me and my husband ordered 2 sandwiches to go for our trip back to LA.
4719,FOOD#POSITIVE,Not a lot of comments here other than to say this place has made huge portions and weird combinations a winner.
4720,FOOD#POSITIVE,I am in awe how others rated this restaurant and no near a 4 stars - perhaps it's the portion size that's worth the 4 stars.
4721,FOOD#POSITIVE,This is also the first place in town I have seen that has Diet Mountain Dew at the soda fountain.
4722,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There was no shortage of meat options either...crab legs, flank steak, beef a jus black truffle, blackened salmon, spicy chicken sausage, beef brisket, pork ribs...and of course sections of Asian and Mexican food, breads, cheeses, salads, and Italian food provided plenty of options."
4723,FOOD#POSITIVE,And I loved how the food was already pre-portioned.
4724,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They have green tea cookies, chocolate cookies, espresso tarts, mousses, cheese cakes, cupcakes, cake pops, everything!"
4725,FOOD#POSITIVE,Every bite was better and just melts in your mouth.
4726,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Outstanding ambiance, cocktails, view and service sums up my experience at Mon Ami Gabi."
4727,FOOD#POSITIVE,You'd have to have one ridiculous sweet tooth for this place.
4728,FOOD#POSITIVE,We started with a glass of wine at the bar - by the way they are a Wine Spectator Restaurant Award winner.
4729,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Overall, great food, but I wish the service wasn't so poor."
4730,FOOD#POSITIVE,"It probably still only cost them $2 a bottle, but mixed with their orange juice, which was pretty good and seemed house-made, made for an excellent mimosa."
4731,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The desserts were substantial in my opinion; a very comprehensive sorbet and gelato bar, along with the obligatory selection of pastries, etc."
4732,FOOD#POSITIVE,I thought the cold ones tasted better and were less salty than the heated ones.
4733,FOOD#POSITIVE,Definitely try to order items you don't normally see at other Thai restaurants.
4734,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food was all good, but nothing special and I've paid less for better on the Strip."
4735,FOOD#POSITIVE,There's enough food to feed a whole country.
4736,FOOD#POSITIVE,Lots of good choices; the chefs are friendly.
4737,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Potatoes: I love mashed potatoes, and the Bellagio didn't disappoint."
4738,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The day we went, Friday\/Saturday dinner was at $50.99 (show your players card for a $1 discount per person)

Probably one of the better looking buffets on the strip."
4739,FOOD#POSITIVE,Props to the chefs for everything being so well done and beautifully.
4740,FOOD#POSITIVE,Our waiter took care of our table of 11 with ease and barely left any plates after 2 minutes of completion.
4741,FOOD#POSITIVE,I don't know about you but I only visit probably AT MOST once a month for about 2-3 months and stop for half a year and do it again.. so the food is always different.
4742,FOOD#POSITIVE,The variety of section is impressive.
4743,FOOD#POSITIVE,Five star is for the number of vegan friendly options in the buffet.
4744,FOOD#POSITIVE,Real subtle twists on already tasty Thai food favorites.
4745,FOOD#POSITIVE,The dessert presenation is pretty and elegant.
4746,FOOD#POSITIVE,"It was A LOT of food so if you order two plate for two people, you might not able to finish it."
4747,FOOD#POSITIVE,The Buffet at the Wynn is an excellent value and offers insane selection of food.
4748,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Crab Claws \/ Salmon \/ Mussels \/ Oysters Rockefeller \/ Sea Bass \/ Cobia \/

International creations \/ Many Vegan options \/ 

There was a line @ the made-to-order Crepe Station."
4749,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Ok, so the breakfast\/brunch on the weekends is amazing."
4750,FOOD#POSITIVE,We also got to sample some of their dinner items once it hit 3PM before taking off and their dinner selection has more seafood!
4751,FOOD#POSITIVE,It was a whirlwind night and I can't remember everything that happened but the food was delicious and the prices were reasonable.
4752,FOOD#POSITIVE,As for sandwiches this is as close to a five as I can give for a sandwich.
4753,FOOD#POSITIVE,10:15 or 10:30 is a good time to get breakfast pricing (and their bfast options are amazing!
4754,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They have tacos and many choices for Chinese food- char siu pork, bao and dumplings."
4755,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Great food, awesome wine list, high quality stems, friendly service and reasonable prices."
4756,FOOD#POSITIVE,Add a glass of merlot or cabernet and you have a blissful dinner listening to opera music from across the street.
4757,FOOD#POSITIVE,"However, even questionable service still doesn't compare to the impeccable food."
4758,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I agree with other reviewers, it's a hike to get here from the hotel entrance, and there's nothing in between, but once you get here it is pretty dang tasty."
4759,FOOD#POSITIVE,These tiny concoctions truly are a delight to the eye as well as the tummy.
4760,FOOD#POSITIVE,It was fun to share the Frozen Hot chocolate with my sweetie!
4761,FOOD#POSITIVE,"(The fountains start at 3 pm weekdays, noon Saturday and 11 am Sunday)

Despite the mixup with the fountains, our meal was fabulous."
4762,FOOD#POSITIVE,2-3 laps around the restaurant before stuffing your stomach with your uncontrollable appetite that you still have from all the delicious food.
4763,FOOD#POSITIVE,Decent sandwiches but somewhat small.
4764,FOOD#POSITIVE,Please save room for dessert as their gelato bar is as good as any other gelato bar that you have to normally pay-per-scoop!
4765,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food is good for the price and the portions are huge.
4766,FOOD#POSITIVE,Portions were so HUGE I felt myself getting fatter just watching to food go by.
4767,FOOD#POSITIVE,I did notice a cheese station that was a nice touch and their mashed potatoes drizzled with truffle oil were AMAZING (I still think about them to this day!).
4768,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Personally, I would rather go to Wicked Spoon for brunch since they have bloody marys and an awesome dessert section as well!"
4769,FOOD#POSITIVE,My bf and I shared the sage fried chicken and bacon waffles and we were both stuffed at the end of our meal.
4770,FOOD#POSITIVE,So many delicious options it was hard to choose..
4771,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They have an assortment of stations which include an Asian station with soups, dim sum, sushi rolls, etc; a pasta station, omelette station, breads, salads, cheese and meats; pancakes, waffles, and french toast station; carvery station with prime rib and other yummy meats they cut in front of you...did I mention I love their dessert station?"
4772,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The dessert selection, I will admit, is amazing."
4773,FOOD#POSITIVE,The presentation and plating is stellar.
4774,FOOD#POSITIVE,It's the the best outdoor style cafe experience in Vegas (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=NTpchPgwPnFIER56x1dz1Q#NTpchPgwPnFIER56x1dz1Q).
4775,FOOD#POSITIVE,Worth a visit to say you've done a Vegas brunch and the selections are astounding!
4776,FOOD#POSITIVE,I'm not a dessert guy but it even tempts me to try stuff.
4777,FOOD#POSITIVE,Higher quality of food with so many choices.
4778,FOOD#POSITIVE,Lots of variety of food and everything I tried was very tasteful... but they didn't have too Many desserts..price is pretty decent...
4779,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The spread was quite impressive, with many different types of food, lots of vegetarian options and tons of desserts."
4780,FOOD#POSITIVE,Dessert bar was awesome... You can't go wrong with any selection.
4781,FOOD#POSITIVE,i highly recommend this sandwich restaurant if you are looking for a good cheap meal any time of the day.
4782,FOOD#POSITIVE,They have so many different types of sandwiches and this place is always packed with young beautiful people in Vegas.
4783,FOOD#POSITIVE,It now seems like it will pack much more of a punch which was my original criticism of it.
4784,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I was mighty full by the time I hit the dessert bar so, while I was quite impressed with the presentations, I statyed away fro most of ht pretty looking unknown treats."
4785,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The reason it's better is simple, portion controlled dishes so that you get the dish exactly the way the chefs want you to."
4786,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Cookies, cake, brownies, risotto, brisket, truffle potatoes, soup, paella, and charcuterie."
4787,FOOD#POSITIVE,Definitely a nice buffet to try a variety of items and get some nice presentation and eye candy from it that you miss out on when you go to a buffet as to a fine dining restaurant in Vegas.
4788,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Anywho, overall, the burgers were good, just not as good as I would've expected from GR."
4789,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Some favorite items - prime rib, mushroom & steak pot, roast beef panini, korean short rib, truffle potatoes."
4790,FOOD#POSITIVE,the sampling of items allows to try many of the delicious items without overeating.
4791,FOOD#POSITIVE,Selection:  4.
4792,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The sheer selection of burger cheeses, toppings, and beers that I had no clue what it was was startling."
4793,FOOD#POSITIVE,Lots of dessert options too!
4794,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I'll be coming back very soon :D

P.S., the bread pudding is very heavy......so try sharing it with at least 3 people."
4795,FOOD#POSITIVE,But if you want to challenge your friend to something they could never finish (like we did for a laugh)  the chicken and waffles are soooooooooooo big.
4796,FOOD#POSITIVE,Good customer service and decent enough sandwiches to help fight your hunger.
4797,FOOD#POSITIVE,Really good and a huge variety of food.
4798,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The presentation was beautiful with many of the dishes coming in their own little bowls, plates or silver pans."
4799,FOOD#POSITIVE,Their selection of juices were pretty good.
4800,FOOD#POSITIVE,I have to say that the dessert display is very impressive.
4801,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The spread is impressive, and most of the dishes were executed well and solid, but it didn't quite have the wow factor."
4802,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I'm a foodie
Love food
This was fun and yummy
Wished I had an empty vat as a stomach so I could have tried everything!"
4803,FOOD#POSITIVE,the drunken noodles were just right too in terms of combination of spices and flavors.
4804,FOOD#POSITIVE,How about authentic Chinese food?
4805,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Sure, they admit that the place is a hidden away in a shopping plaza and doesn't look like much but that the food is phenomenal for the price."
4806,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Yes, prices border on the outrageous, but the restaurant is on prime real estate and again, the place has no sense of portion control."
4807,FOOD#POSITIVE,The variety of the food was vast (though I have to admit I did not try many of the Asian dishes as it was all at the far end of the buffet and I had already had enough on my plate(s) by the time I made it to that side.
4808,FOOD#POSITIVE,loved the Dessert section!
4809,FOOD#POSITIVE,The cold cut and cheese section was varied and quite good.
4810,FOOD#POSITIVE,The dessert section was the best out of all the buffets I've been to.
4811,FOOD#POSITIVE,I will also say I appreciated the presentation and plating - very well done.
4812,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Vegas is expensive, but this place serves up fantastic food at realistic prices."
4813,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Presentation of their items is great, which could be contributing to the hype."
4814,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The plating and presentation is amazing, but it's lacking taste."
4815,FOOD#POSITIVE,So many different beautifully layed out options that it's virtually impossible to choose from...a feast for the sugar addict for sure!
4816,FOOD#POSITIVE,"My favorite, of course, was the dessert station which included a variety of homemade ice cream flavors and toppings."
4817,FOOD#POSITIVE,The had a variety of things from raw seafood to grilled meats to chinese food.
4818,FOOD#POSITIVE,But the food is unbeatable.
4819,FOOD#POSITIVE,"great variety, watchout for warm plates at desert bar ( chilled plate best ) mac n cheese bar made to order = worth the wait."
4820,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The dessert was just amazing love everything that alone will come back for :) 

Love the setting and ambience not your average buffet."
4821,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Amenities are new, there's a lot of space, the buffet selections are plentiful and the service is good."
4822,FOOD#POSITIVE,"While the presentation of the food (in the small little pans and pots) is impressive, the quality of the food is just OK."
4823,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I'm not a huge sweets gal so that's why, but it does look lovely!"
4824,FOOD#POSITIVE,My husband for the nutella waffles and thought they were good but not excellent.
4825,FOOD#POSITIVE,"haha 

You could also never go wrong with CHICKEN SA-TAY in the appetizer section, but if you haaad to choose definitely go with the STUFFED CHICKEN WINGS!"
4826,FOOD#POSITIVE,"It was a spectacular meal and lives up to the ""best Thai in the country"" reputation."
4827,FOOD#POSITIVE,The desserts are amazing too!
4828,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I tried the Andy's sage fried chicken benedicts, delicious and huge portion."
4829,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Portions are out of control, but you're in Vegas, go big or go home."
4830,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Carving station was awesome- BBQ chicken, ribs, brisket, prime rib, lamb chops."
4831,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I mean yes quality it was good but diversity also, not so much."
4832,FOOD#POSITIVE,"This is my favorite place for breakfast in Vegas, sit outside with views across to Bellagio, great croissants (ask for conserve, jam) and eggs Benedict, ask for salmon and avocado and they will do it for you as a Benedict."
4833,FOOD#POSITIVE,I have been here over a year ago and I thought the food was delicious and presentation was nice.
4834,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Although we were in waiting line for about 1 hour because of holiday, diversity of food was good."
4835,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Presentation gets high marks, but quality - which is so much more important - negates those high marks."
4836,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I ordered an old fashioned for myself which was nice and a lemon drop for the wife(not sure of quality but she pounded it sooo....)

Then we had the endive, rouqefort salad which had a nice balance of walnuts, cheese and spinach($13)."
4837,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food was ah-mazing, the decor was beautiful, the menu was unique, the service was exceptional."
4838,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Here, the potatoes are pre-portioned into precious little stainless steel mini-saucepans."
4839,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I've eaten a lot of Thai foods in Asia and in the U.S, this is not the best but one of the better Thai places to eat... Tonight was my first time and I know I will be back again.... excellent food and excellent service."
4840,FOOD#POSITIVE,"This place has some truly outrageous food, some to outrageous."
4841,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I always end up getting the vanilla ice cream topped with nuts and caramel and fudge sauce...mmmmmmhmmmmm

There were a lot more dishes that I didn't name here that were available, the full menu should be available on the Bellagio website."
4842,FOOD#POSITIVE,"While the food we tried across the different palattes was good, it wasn't mind blowing."
4843,FOOD#POSITIVE,There is a good variety.
4844,FOOD#POSITIVE,We got in line around 10:30 and was able to get the last of the breakfast items before the lunch roll over happened.
4845,FOOD#POSITIVE,Me and my girlfriend went and filled our table with endless plates with all different types of foods.
4846,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Always stellar service, food, and atmosphere."
4847,FOOD#POSITIVE,One member of our party remarked that he was trying so many new things he felt like he needed to take the food item name plates from the buffet back to the table so he could remember what everything was.
4848,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Nice selection of food: Italian, Chinese, Japanese, salad bar, bread bar, appetizer bar, and large assortment of decorative desserts."
4849,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Italian, Asian, and Mexican cuisines, as well as American comfort food staples, were represented at its buffet stations."
4850,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I don't normally enjoy eating Thai food, but this place was pretty good!"
4851,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The watermelon siracha was innovative, the goat cheese w lavender amazing, and the sphagetti Nero w langoustine out of this world!"
4852,FOOD#POSITIVE,What wins me over at the Wynn is their dessert section.
4853,FOOD#POSITIVE,The King Crab Legs were a nice size and pre-split but I was somewhat disappointed that they were served cold.
4854,FOOD#POSITIVE,Their selections were great and have foods I haven't seen at other buffets or tasted such as a made to order creamy seafood sauce with veggies to your liking poured inside a puff pastry bowl (I don't remember the actual name but it starts with Vul).
4855,FOOD#POSITIVE,Displays the type of European style of outdoor eating.
4856,FOOD#POSITIVE,There was a nice variety of items and we loved the plethora of dessert options as well.
4857,FOOD#POSITIVE,I love the small dish concept.
4858,FOOD#POSITIVE,The restaurant offers a variety of its specialty cocktails as well as specialty beers from the bottle or tap.
4859,FOOD#POSITIVE,"This place is fun, the food is great and very affordable for the strip."
4860,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Better meat selection, better sushi (although I see it sub par), best in dessert hands down, better service, and of course better pricing."
4861,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Their desserts were so unique, so many things I've never seen or heard of... they all sounded and looked so delightful but none of them were..."
4862,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food here is solid good

But am hard pressed to find out how the yelp stars are so generous

Aside from the nice toasted bread many of the offerings are solid good but not something I would give 4 stars for ... it's my bias but I think that the crowds eating here @PH are younger and maybe a bit more forgiving with their younger palette preferences

Out of all the options ... if your here for the first time i suggest trying something different like Hawaiian BBQ

I suggest skipping the tomato soup."
4863,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Probably the best part of the entire buffet is the dessert section, with delicious gourmet treats and a great gelato selection."
4864,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I mean, it's no DTF (in Taiwan), but they made them a lot better than many a Chinese restaurant I've been to, not to mention that they are served individually in adorable miniature steamers and retain their soup very well."
4865,FOOD#POSITIVE,Asian food was so much to choose from it was like a Chinese buffet restaurant all on its own.
4866,FOOD#POSITIVE,"From presentation to freshness and quality, every item they served was delicious and the selection is incredible."
4867,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Overall, I'd give this place 5 stars for friendly service and amazingly large and creative portions, but only 3 stars on taste that doesn't match presentation."
4868,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They had an excellent selection of cake pops, bread pudding, cute little pastries, and savory gelato and sorbet flavors."
4869,FOOD#POSITIVE,I really enjoyed their made to order soup station.
4870,FOOD#POSITIVE,Excellent quality and selection.
4871,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I would recommend trying stuff that's from Issan, Northern Thailand, or Chef's choice because c'mon... you can get Pad See Ew and Pad Thai anywhere."
4872,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Red Velvet Pancakes, the greatest bacon ever, and great service earned 5 stars."
4873,FOOD#POSITIVE,I liked how the dishes were portioned off.
4874,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There are seven different sections including seafood, sushi, breads, cheeses, tacos, meats and even fresh juices."
4875,FOOD#POSITIVE,The stations just got longer and longer and it seemed like they would never end.
4876,FOOD#POSITIVE,They were nicely presented but I wish they taste as good as they look.
4877,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food here was superb.
4878,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food was excellent.
4879,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Next few areas were chilled crab legs which were cut in half length wise, cocktail shrimp, stone crab claws and dungress crab."
4880,FOOD#POSITIVE,Meaning more selection than you can ever try.
4881,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I totally recommend coming here for dessert, esp during dinner."
4882,FOOD#POSITIVE,"While there was a lot to choose from, there were only a few items that stood out to me: the steamed BBQ buns, the meatballs, the beef burria, crab legs and cocktail shrimp, and the coconut macaroons."
4883,FOOD#POSITIVE,Our family of 4 ate there and my husband and I didn't eat again the rest of the day!!
4884,FOOD#POSITIVE,I don't think I have such a wonderful sandwich for a very long time..
4885,FOOD#POSITIVE,Food was super delicious too!!
4886,FOOD#POSITIVE,Seriously the most impressive array of buffet offerings I have ever laid eyes on.
4887,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The service here is what makes The Hash House A Go Go standout from other restaurants on the strip, alongside their humongous food portions."
4888,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Fresh mussels, fried chicken, BLT salad, Mac n cheese, sushi, gelato bar."
4889,FOOD#POSITIVE,"first of all, the food was good."
4890,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Excellent service, HUGE portion sizes and all of our food was delicious!"
4891,FOOD#POSITIVE,I had a strawberry vinaigrette that surprisingly worked and a pistachio that was actually nutty.
4892,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They were everything that everybody has said about them.....huge, delicious, crazy."
4893,FOOD#POSITIVE,All others in the party were equally pleased with the size of their meal!
4894,FOOD#POSITIVE,"In Vegas, there are just too many choices to deal with below average food."
4895,FOOD#POSITIVE,"BurGR is a top notch place, great service, nice friendly staff and excellent tasting food."
4896,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The coffee was perfect, the service was pleasant and quick enough."
4897,FOOD#POSITIVE,Fun Place and their famous roast beef sandwich is Fantastic!
4898,FOOD#POSITIVE,"But by the time you have your first bite, you know it's worth the wait."
4899,FOOD#POSITIVE,Pairing of white wine was delicious with our dishes .
4900,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food here is amazing!
4901,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Nua Nam Tok - (Spice Level 4) Very similar to the flavors of the Nam Kao Top, good but not great."
4902,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I was able to find a selection of different foods that I wanted to try, and most of them I enjoyed."
4903,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Some of the good dishes served -- sticky rice wrapped in bamboo leaves (excellent), Chinese porridge with Chinese donuts (very good), steamed dumplings (shao long bao) in individual small pie dishes, a Chinese herbal soup, honey walnut shrimp (not that bad for buffet), and other various items."
4904,FOOD#POSITIVE,salads had nice presentation though.
4905,FOOD#POSITIVE,The beer selection is rather European as well.
4906,FOOD#POSITIVE,Just ate the turkey holiday sandwich  A+ (only around until early Jan).
4907,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Apple Chicken Sausage - don't really like sausage, but it was tasty
Biscuit & Gravy - good
Tried a few cheeses, they were a lil strong for my palette

The dessert area was just over flowing with chocolate greatness, but I'm not a chocolate fan...Whomp whomp!"
4908,FOOD#POSITIVE,The strawberry shortcake and gelato were the best dessert options.
4909,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I find that most places are sit down with HUGE portions, but honestly, after a night of drinking and dancing, this place always hits the spot."
4910,FOOD#POSITIVE,"the desserts werent as good as the Wynn, but Wicked Spoon wins for concept and variety."
4911,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The wine list is extensive, and the wine cart is one of the charms we enjoy."
4912,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They even started a fresh juice\/water section with hibiscus water, mango juice, and horchata."
4913,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Also ordered and drank the BLT bloody mary with bacon, lettuce and tomato along with toast lol, very strong."
4914,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Besides the ambiance, I also loved the tapas style of dishes."
4915,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Both our meals were very good, but the presentation of the waffles and chicken the table got next to us was spectacular."
4916,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Desserts were always the best part of a buffet, as it helped push your stomach beyond the limits with attractive looking sweets placed in tiny shot glasses."
4917,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The dessert section is fairly large too- lots of gelatos, cakes, and other sweet treats."
4918,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Seafood: shrimps with cocktail sauce were good, was told the crab legs were just ok.

Desserts: always delicious, carrot cake was good and a few others

Drinks: they have some healthy drinks on the far right of the buffet in the morning\/brunch hours which are good and the red alc drink, sorry forgot name and didn't take pic of name on all you can drink menu, is good but all depends on how sweet you like things

Chinese: all the ""dim sum"" is shrimp, didn't try the ""congee"" but not sure how you can mess that up."
4919,FOOD#POSITIVE,I personally enjoyed the dessert bar here more than the food.
4920,FOOD#POSITIVE,Great vegetarian options.
4921,FOOD#POSITIVE,"But still, very good....but by far the best part of the meal were the ""Pancakes"" They are actually a stack of Crepes, and they are amazing."
4922,FOOD#POSITIVE,Dessert also looked so impressive but only the gelato was decent.
4923,FOOD#POSITIVE,"However I rate it with a 4 star because the all you can drink champagne for 7$ , the organization and all the type of food we were able to try makes it worth visiting at the Ceaser Palace hotel in las vegas"
4924,FOOD#POSITIVE,"the food is truly exceptional, and the wine list is one of the best in the country, PERIOD, and easily the finest in any Asian restaurant I have ever seen."
4925,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Something that sets them apart from other buffets (that I know of) is not only do they have delectable food, but they also serve them in individually-sized containers."
4926,FOOD#POSITIVE,The burgers are obviously delicious and there are plenty to choose from-including non beef items.
4927,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Much of the food is pre-portioned in little ramekins, serving pans, etc, which is super cute if you're into presentation like I am."
4928,FOOD#POSITIVE,The chefs will also heat up your crab legs if you don't like cold crab legs.
4929,FOOD#POSITIVE,They've got all kinds of bla bla bla compote reduced with a something or other sauce pared nicely with a snippet of something that is PRESENTED to you as if YOU were one of those celebrity judges on Iron Chef!!!
4930,FOOD#POSITIVE,Croque Madame was fine but the seafood crepe was show-stopper.
4931,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food is served in huge portions but they don't taste extraordinary.
4932,FOOD#POSITIVE,He is literally creating new dishes on the fly on almost a daily basis (in 10 days of opening they had 7 menu change!)
4933,FOOD#POSITIVE,"-Beef with basil: Very good but was okay in comparison to the other dishes
-Mango and sticky rice with coconut ice cream: Thai food is not complete until you get this dish."
4934,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Food is the best, they are really consistent so you can come back anytime and the food would be the same, that what get the score."
4935,FOOD#POSITIVE,"This is not to say that this buffet does not have a great selection, as it does...but the food flavors themselves were left quite a bit to be desired."
4936,FOOD#POSITIVE,Had quite a bit of options but again the quality wasn't great.
4937,FOOD#POSITIVE,PRIME RIB and all the other meat section - pretty decent!
4938,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The majority of dishes are served in small, pre-portioned sizes giving that tapas vibe."
4939,FOOD#POSITIVE,"It's pretty cool how they portion out their food so a lot of it doesn't go to waste and you can actually keep track of how many servings you intake, but I mean, that's about it."
4940,FOOD#POSITIVE,Food: Good choices i loved the Pasta.
4941,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Likes:  
Individual mini-plates that are both beautiful and tasty
Gluten-Free dessert options
Variety - they had a carving station, sushi, salads, cheeses and dried fruits, hot crab legs pre-split, soups, and so much more!"
4942,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The other entries were above your average buffet, which was nice, and which was expected at the price and location."
4943,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The dessert selection was amazing, though!"
4944,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Efficient, they serve up the sandwiches like neatly packaged bricks in foil wrappers...
http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=nbZOfLY7cUr2tnubkswwlQ

At first, I thought The Full Montagu was a play on words on The Full Monty, or maybe some Shakespearean reference -- was there also a Full Capulet sandwich (although it's really spelled ""Montague"");  no, actually it's in reference to John Montagu, the 4th Earl of Sandwich with whom the sandwich is named."
4945,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Amazing food, great service, and even better view!"
4946,FOOD#POSITIVE,"How could you go wrong with so many great desserts, from delicate little creams to vast fields of chocolate covered strawberries...mmmm!"
4947,FOOD#POSITIVE,There's way more chunks of crab vs. other chinese places where I've ordered the same dish.
4948,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I just adore the little pans filled with savory mac-n-cheese, Italian gnocchi, fresh salmon, mashed potatoes, curry fried rice, and more!"
4949,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They also have a huge menu, so there's a lot of dishes to choose from."
4950,FOOD#POSITIVE,Food options were plenty as well as desserts.
4951,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Gourmet food, intelligentsia coffee, patio seating, amazing hash browns."
4952,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Yummy Asian dishes , dumplings, char Sui , prime rib, come hungry"
4953,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Korean, Mexican, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, American cuisines & moooore!"
4954,FOOD#POSITIVE,I wouldn't get some of the dishes you could order at normal thai restaurants.
4955,FOOD#POSITIVE,Earl of Sandwich has really good sandwiches at very affordable prices and IT'S OPEN 24 HOURS!!
4956,FOOD#POSITIVE,Creative mini dishes.
4957,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I wish he warned us about portion size, had we know how big the plates were, we would have split an order."
4958,FOOD#POSITIVE,Huge selection with really tasty dishes.
4959,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food was, without a doubt, cooked to perfection - as expected from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant."
4960,FOOD#POSITIVE,After trying to make the best of it we became increasingly unhappy with the food and service and complained.
4961,FOOD#POSITIVE,"For meat eaters, your taste buds can dance as they have an array of meats, ranging from salmon to veal."
4962,FOOD#POSITIVE,Personally I liked this method and found that each entree was better prepared than at most other buffets where the entree is typically served in a large pan and you scoop up as much as you want.
4963,FOOD#POSITIVE,"If the food that I had was hotter, Prime Rib more tender, and the person at the caving station was nicer to me."
4964,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Coming to America is has been hard to find authentic, excellent Thai!"
4965,FOOD#POSITIVE,":(
While the food was good, I ordered a cosmo along with the ladies I work with and it was made with a lemon vodka for sure."
4966,FOOD#POSITIVE,The make-your-own Bloody Mary's is a fun diversion - you're your own best or worst enemy there.
4967,FOOD#POSITIVE,I was in total shock when I saw how HUGE HUGE HUGE the portions were.
4968,FOOD#POSITIVE,"In general I would say the food was good, but not fabulous."
4969,FOOD#POSITIVE,Chinese food was good.
4970,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They have sundaes made to be shared, and I doubt any one could eat one without some help!"
4971,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Seating is fantastic, decor is wonderful, food is high quality but not the highest quality so don't go in expecting lobster tails and filet mignon steaks."
4972,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The sushi counter is great because it is the ONLY sushi bar in Vegas I know of that utilizes ebi furai in the roll instead of regular tempura--just the way I like it (that's how they did it up in Japan when we went and back on Guam as I was growing up, so I love ebi furai in sushi)."
4973,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I liked the Northern Thai dishes, and I enjoyed the meal, but what with the renaissance of Thai food in the Tenderloin, this was a pricey choice for a meal that usually is pretty terrific in San Francisco at a much lower cost."
4974,FOOD#POSITIVE,But I do love their beautiful dessert selection!
4975,FOOD#POSITIVE,"We had tons of finished plates and when we came back with new plates of food, there wasn't any space to put them.. 

Other than that, my tummy was very satisfied!"
4976,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I can`t say that the food was bad, it was pretty good and the server helped us to choose wine, but I didn`t like the service, it was slow."
4977,FOOD#POSITIVE,Sushi selection was the best of all Vegas buffets.
4978,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Sushi, pork buns, chowmein, ribs, steak, pizza, pasta, chicken and waffles... you name it they've got it!"
4979,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I liked the warmed crab legs, a lot of buffets don't offer that but they have both options here and always plentiful."
4980,FOOD#POSITIVE,Premade servings made it possible to try everything!They have so much its hard to pick!
4981,FOOD#POSITIVE,Sandwiches were huge and worth the dollars.
4982,FOOD#POSITIVE,"That being said, the food itself made the $55 worth it."
4983,FOOD#POSITIVE,The best thing I ate was here were the lamb chops.
4984,FOOD#POSITIVE,"A lot of the dishes come on little individual plates, bowls our even lil baskets for the fried foods."
4985,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Not only was the service fast, friendly, and amazing, but the food was above and beyond our expectations."
4986,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The panna cotta was also very delicious ^q^

Overall, although it was pricy, I had a good experience."
4987,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Food: 
You get quite a spread here with the following stations each with approx 4-5 dishes laid out."
4988,FOOD#POSITIVE,"If you LOVE food, this is the place to be."
4989,FOOD#POSITIVE,"It comes with an assortment of things to dip (cucumber, cabbage, green beans, broccoli, cauliflower, fried pork rinds), and you can order a side of sticky rice to go with it."
4990,FOOD#POSITIVE,BurGR was extremely good.
4991,FOOD#POSITIVE,"But nonetheless, I really enjoyed the food, ambiance, and company."
4992,FOOD#POSITIVE,We ended with deserts which were quite nice.
4993,FOOD#POSITIVE,"However, if you want to sample a number of different items, want some quality with your quantitiy, want to stuff yourself on nothing but crab legs and shrimp, desire a fairly nice setting, don't mind the wait, and are stuck on the Strip, then the Wynn buffet is a serious consideration."
4994,FOOD#POSITIVE,Meat - the prime rib here looks good visually but it is flavorless with no beefy flavor and juices that taste like nothing.
4995,FOOD#POSITIVE,It definitely has a Parisian feel and the breakfast food is wonderful.
4996,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Dessert was EXCEPTIONAL: 18 varieties of gelato including Strawberry Balsamic, Salted Caramel, and Coffee White Chocolate; Stuffed mini doughnuts; cakes; cupcakes; and peach cobbler."
4997,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Sweet baby Jesus, there is every kind of protein, carb & type of cuisine under the hot, Vegas sun that one could possibly dream about having for breakfast & brunch at this buffet."
4998,FOOD#POSITIVE,I love how some of the dishes are served in little skillets and the fried chicken wings in little fryers!
4999,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I love that they have things in little pots or little bowls for you to take back to your table, it's so cute!"
5000,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Food was displayed so beautifully, but some of the dishes weren't that good."
5001,FOOD#POSITIVE,Huge selection of different types of food and every breakfast item imaginable.
5002,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Tasty food, spacious location with  nice ambience."
5003,FOOD#POSITIVE,I think that even though food was good it is not worth the money.
5004,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There was a lot of variety from traditional breakfast of eggs, bacon, and pancakes to more ethnic varieties of tacos, sushi, dimsum, and pasta."
5005,FOOD#POSITIVE,The amount of food here is indescribable.
5006,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I liked the single little dishes they put out for taste portions 
- Deep fried broccoli cheese casserole: surprising favorite 
- American plating: loved the little buckets for the tater tots and waffle fries and the mini fry basket with a piece of fried chicken and sweet potato fries
- Brisket: nice rub on the outside and liked the option of BBQ sauces
- Red velvet whoopie pie: soft and on point flavors for a authentic rendition 
- Dessert variety: from cupcakes and cookies to bread pudding to unique gelato flavors to made to order crepes to sugar free desserts and  more, there was tons to choose from

Midlights:
- Good amount of empty spots: those items looked good but guess they were so popular they ran out 


Lowlights:
- Shrimp: cold one tasted a bit fishy and the hot one with heads were overlooked 
- Spicy fried fish: was excited for this dish but wasn't that great--probably because it was sitting out
- Meat inconsistency: some was dry

Some items were great but as with most buffets others were mediocre."
5007,FOOD#POSITIVE,"),  bone marrow, sushi, fish, chicken, carving stations, soup, fish stations, salad, asian station, etc.....I can go on forever!"
5008,FOOD#POSITIVE,I could eat one of their mini veal sliders right now.
5009,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The Asian section tasted like Asian cuisines, typically that does not happen unless it is an Asian place serving buffet."
5010,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I have yet to have a bad meal there, service is A+, they come and refill your water without you needing to ask and very polite."
5011,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Food is good, more appealing in presentation and size."
5012,FOOD#POSITIVE,This signature dish definitely lived up to its hype.
5013,FOOD#POSITIVE,Wine list was great - at lunch time they had a wine cart so you could see the bottles and take a taste if desired.
5014,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They have a variety of stations which offer a selection of foods from: breakfast food, southern comfort, seafood bar, juice bar, mexican, italian, asian food, carving station."
5015,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There are so many options to choose from, whatever you like, you have a good chance of finding it here."
5016,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Great steak and fish dishes, a good variety of wines to choose from and wonderful desserts make this a place worth visiting twice!"
5017,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Huge portion, good for a group people."
5018,FOOD#POSITIVE,"More importantly, the food is extraordinary and the presentation (very important) is welcoming and appetizing."
5019,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Finally, the food was an overwhelming array of good quality ingredients and preparations, featuring a variety of cuisine cultures, and a spectacular selection of desserts."
5020,FOOD#POSITIVE,Just outstanding so much variety and great quality.
5021,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Fresh, inventive, delicious comfort food and ginormous portions!"
5022,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Overall, the food was delicious and I'd definitely go back."
5023,FOOD#POSITIVE,I was very impressed they had bone marrow at the carving station as well.
5024,FOOD#POSITIVE,Hard to find anything more authentic than those.
5025,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Long story short, I would never return there and strongly advise others against it as well, the only reason it gets 2 stars is because the food was decent, service is terrible and aside from the general manager, management was very unprofessional."
5026,FOOD#POSITIVE,+Dessert selection was amazing... pity I had no more room to indulge.
5027,FOOD#POSITIVE,Overal this place gives you alot of food.
5028,FOOD#POSITIVE,its kind of a world buffet in a way.
5029,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Yes, it's good, but I'm not dying to go back, probably because I have so many options here!"
5030,FOOD#POSITIVE,Excellent food.
5031,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food was amazing, and very reasonably priced."
5032,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The best part was the dessert, but it still didn't make up for the lack of cold dry food."
5033,FOOD#POSITIVE,"i'm not a sandwich person, but a must-visit for a cheap quality meal after lady luck takes a dump on your chest."
5034,FOOD#POSITIVE,Great Food w a lots of flavor and a excellent service.
5035,FOOD#POSITIVE,"It has a huge selection of food, with highlights from each station that I will always remember!"
5036,FOOD#POSITIVE,They have so many dessert options as well.
5037,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Open 24 Hours: This place has great reviews at first glance, and Yeah, ok...the sandwiches are good, but is it one of the best sandwiches I've ever had??"
5038,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There was an assortment of beautifully decorated desserts for days, a lot of the foods were presented in these tiny wire baskets and the ambiance is very warm."
5039,FOOD#POSITIVE,Presentation really makes this place.
5040,FOOD#POSITIVE,"OMG, Not only is the food delicious,  no matter what you oder the food is off the chain."
5041,FOOD#POSITIVE,I thought that the concept of this place is awesome; they have a big variety of beer and some very tasty shakes.
5042,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There was a variety of American, Mexican, and Asian food."
5043,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food was not cooked and the frozen hot chocolate tasted like it was ran down with water, which I think was the case."
5044,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Also, due to the huge selection and division of offerings, the lines aren't long."
5045,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Through the drunk days and nights if you want a delicious sandwich at a affordable price, go to Earls :D"
5046,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food choices are insane.
5047,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Large pieces of shrimp, small oysters, and mounds of crab legs(cold or hot)."
5048,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food was incredibly fresh, and the presentation was beautiful."
5049,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The selection was gr8 (seafood, meats, wide array of asian food but no sashimi?"
5050,FOOD#POSITIVE,"This place is the typical large selection of foods, but it comes with great quality."
5051,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I loved that lots of items were served in individual pots\/plates\/cups, they have great presentation!!"
5052,FOOD#POSITIVE,A lot of dishes had there own separate container which were really cute!
5053,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They have a wonderful selection of meats, cheeses and breads."
5054,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Their must have been 30 or 40 desserts at this place including fudge, all sorts of pastries, 15 different flavors of gelato, chocolates, etc."
5055,FOOD#POSITIVE,The presentation of the food is probably just as good as the food itself.
5056,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Usually portion size is an inverse indicator of food quality but at HH, the food is good!"
5057,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I appreciated the selection and the exotic foods, but some were mediocre."
5058,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The portions are just right, as you're able to sample a bunch of different foods without over doing it on the actual intake side of things."
5059,FOOD#POSITIVE,"For entrees, the braised shortribs with panang was very good, especially with sticky rice."
5060,FOOD#POSITIVE,This is currently our favorite Vegas buffet - it is pricy but you will get high-quality food and massive variety.
5061,FOOD#POSITIVE,What I like about this place is the presentation for some of the items.
5062,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Nothing worth talking about with the food, but the beer selection was good."
5063,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Several drinks for $5 and under and even though I can't indulge at the moment myself, the drinks I saw at other tables looked yummy."
5064,FOOD#POSITIVE,The coffee was really good and the prices did not reflect the large portions.
5065,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Food: good and big portions

Service: OK, went there 9am sat down, ordered, a couple came after us , ordered, got their waffle&chicken 5 mins before our food was served."
5066,FOOD#POSITIVE,Also the fried chicken Benedict was outstanding and way to much to eat!!
5067,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Overall, Gordon Ramsay Burgr met the standards of what a burger should taste like, but nothing stood out or was spectacular."
5068,FOOD#POSITIVE,Their seafood selection was mind boggling.
5069,FOOD#POSITIVE,"A tad overwhelmed by the ridiculous portion, but every bite and every urge wanting to pass out was soooo worth it."
5070,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Crab claws, excellent, carving station had more choices than anywhere and the small plate concept for many of the more refined dishes kept the food fresh and more sophisticated."
5071,FOOD#POSITIVE,"However, you get plenty of food, portion size, for more than just yourself!"
5072,FOOD#POSITIVE,The house pate with mustard and toast ($13) was the perfect start to the meal.
5073,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The portions are huge and for the deluxe service you receive, the prices are well worth it."
5074,FOOD#POSITIVE,I love their mexican food here.
5075,FOOD#POSITIVE,I LOVE that this place gives you a separate gluten free pre-meal platter when you order a gluten free meal.
5076,FOOD#POSITIVE,Food.. bangin!
5077,FOOD#POSITIVE,There is a very good selection of food and fast wait staff.
5078,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There are so many dishes to choose from and just about everything is delicious (with a few exceptions; for example, I would avoid the sushi station)."
5079,FOOD#POSITIVE,"My favorite flavors were the Thai tea, passionfruit, mango, and blood orange (My memory is kind of hazy so some of those flavors might or might not have existed...) The only thing I know for sure is I loved the gelato station and it was my favorite part of this whole buffet!"
5080,FOOD#POSITIVE,"For seafood, their crab legs were really good dipped in butter and you could tell it was really fresh compared to other low quality buffets!"
5081,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Sushi, prime rib, chicken, ribs, veggies, 3 or 4 DIFFERENT kinds of mashed potatoes, assorted breads, soups, salad bar, FRESH FRUIT and really too much to try to mention."
5082,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Monstrous proportions, excellent tasting food, and cheaper than most places in Vegas."
5083,FOOD#POSITIVE,No complaints made on the error as the omelette was good.
5084,FOOD#POSITIVE,"So many good food, so little stomach."
5085,FOOD#POSITIVE,Presentation is really superb compared to other buffets in Las Vegas.
5086,FOOD#POSITIVE,I was walking on the Strip with a friend when we decided that a frozen hot chocolate sounded good to cool off ourselves from the heat.
5087,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I mostly tried all the dishes that appealed to me which included the juicy prime rib, shrimp ceviche, bone marrow and vegetarian pot pie."
5088,FOOD#POSITIVE,Also they have great options for soups and salads.
5089,FOOD#POSITIVE,Easily my favorite dish from the restaurant.
5090,FOOD#POSITIVE,Great sandwiches fast service and can I say once again great sandwiches not big on hot sandwiches myself but this place made me change my mind
5091,FOOD#POSITIVE,The burger creations were as eclectic as the place itself; the Farm burger being my favorite.
5092,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Both were great, you also get a fresh baguette, you will want it to sop up the juice from the mussels, my favorite part 
The only downside was the waitstaff, they were all hanging out in front of the bar, literally two feet from us, but never checked in, and it took forever to get our check."
5093,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Desserts are less than the Wynn, but overall pretty good, and always fresh."
5094,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Came back a second time to again enjoy their frozen hot chocolate, and sat at the bar."
5095,FOOD#POSITIVE,I was extremely satisfied with the sandwiches here and had their sandwiches for lunch AND dinner the same day.
5096,FOOD#POSITIVE,They had a great variety of food and I don't think you'd be disappointed.
5097,FOOD#POSITIVE,"So many to choose from, all so yummy AND they had a gelato bar."
5098,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Since we sat at the bar, we discovered that the coveted HC was POWDER MIXED WITH ICE... it pretty much shattered our hopes and dreams, making the experience way less enjoyable."
5099,FOOD#POSITIVE,Great food - Awesome Service and if you can get a spot on the patio on a cool evening to see the fountains at Bellagio across the street you should love it.
5100,FOOD#POSITIVE,But food was GREAT!
5101,FOOD#POSITIVE,All agreed that the croissant on the ham and cheese sammy was better than the stand alone version.
5102,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food here comes in large portions that even someone like me will have a hard time finishing.
5103,FOOD#POSITIVE,All the food and appetizers were phenomenal!
5104,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Buffets tend to get sloppy with their food, but almost everything I had at Bachannal was truly delicious."
5105,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There were also lots of other breakfast options available such as pancakes, waffles, fresh bacon, sausage, biscuits etc."
5106,FOOD#POSITIVE,Aside from the prime rib (it was good but small) they were serving up Kobe beef the night I went.
5107,FOOD#POSITIVE,"And most importantly, the food presentation is Phenomenal!!"
5108,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The pork belly was juicy & delicious, They did not have too many options for desserts, just your standards, I tried almost one of everything but was only happy with the keylime tart."
5109,FOOD#POSITIVE,The most impressive was the seafood section.
5110,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I mean, I've been to Thailand, gone to a Thai cooking class, and eaten every kind of street food there and Lotus of Siam was essentially the same thing minus the plane flight."
5111,FOOD#POSITIVE,It was not more than $25 which is a really good deal for such a good quality buffet like this one.
5112,FOOD#POSITIVE,Great wine selection and the prices are pretty reasonable for a nice strip restaurant.
5113,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The small dish hit the spot, I ordered the ratatouille but I regret purchasing that."
5114,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food is always fresh and all items are always filled.
5115,FOOD#POSITIVE,Both are deep-fried so skip sides or unnecessary carbs.
5116,FOOD#POSITIVE,:) they have a gelato bar INSIDE the buffet... their waffle cone is very tasty!
5117,FOOD#POSITIVE,All other foods looks really nice but it was not good at all.
5118,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The sourdough they served before brunch was great, as was everything else we had (the three of us just shared off of each others plates)."
5119,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The desserts all looked delicious, and most of the ones I tasted (with the exception of the sugar free ones...but I guess that was my fault) were great."
5120,FOOD#POSITIVE,There are many food options and the chocolate dipped strawberries were the size of my fist...no kidding.
5121,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There were many egg dishes (as well as eggs made to order), pancakes, French toast, and several breakfast meat offerings."
5122,FOOD#POSITIVE,The brunch was super good with the food choices.
5123,FOOD#POSITIVE,I felt that the dishes they had offered a little bit more complexity than other buffets.
5124,FOOD#POSITIVE,Food was delicious.
5125,FOOD#POSITIVE,Next our food arrived...it was gigantic!
5126,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food has gotten a lot better then previous years.
5127,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Food good, service sub par."
5128,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Wait was minimal, service outstanding, food...wow."
5129,FOOD#POSITIVE,"O_o 

We had a bunch of leftovers for the next day!"
5130,FOOD#POSITIVE,Normally I don't like buffet eggs benedict but these were good even sitting out.
5131,FOOD#POSITIVE,The buffet is maintained well and so there is nothing sitting out there forever.
5132,FOOD#POSITIVE,"+Great Asian selections
+Dessert selection is pretty good...one of the best things actually."
5133,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I'm guessing the large portions is part of the appeal here, but the flavor was REALLY good...I honestly think if portions were cut in half, and kept at the same high quality standard, this place would do exceptionally well still and hell..probably make a lot more money not spending so much on food."
5134,FOOD#POSITIVE,All the dishes were fantastic-and to think that Thai food couldn't get any better!Customer service can be a bit more accommodating but the food well makes up for it.
5135,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The crab legs are cut for you, and I filled up on these to get my money's worth, though they weren't anything above the crab legs you typically get at a Chinese food buffet."
5136,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food stations were clean unlike last time and each one was full of selections of fresh, tasty goodies."
5137,FOOD#POSITIVE,The burgers are awsome the hells kitchen burger was great my wife had the chanterelle  mushroom burger it was incredible  my daughter  hot dog was like 15 inches long great atmosphere service great
5138,FOOD#POSITIVE,Food: Sooo many options!!
5139,FOOD#POSITIVE,"For more heartier breakfast items, Wicked Spoon had about every dish you would expect to find at one of those all-day breakfast places."
5140,FOOD#POSITIVE,Food: they have tons of meat and tons of seafood.
5141,FOOD#POSITIVE,"3. Notable unique items: self serve sorbet, sugar free desserts (blueberry muffin, cheesecake, apple tart -- although they all tasted a little like chalk)

Get:
Vegetarian pizza
Prime rib - maybe
Cheesecake
Bread pudding (my weakness, personally)
OJ (fresh squeezed!"
5142,FOOD#POSITIVE,"It is definitely one of the more expensive buffets, but the options are much better than your typical buffet."
5143,FOOD#POSITIVE,Been here a couple of times now and each time I stay a super long time because there is just a huge amount and variety of food to eat.
5144,FOOD#POSITIVE,I love they portion many in small dishes so it is easy to get just a taste and try many new things.
5145,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I sampled all the pretty looking ones, and the flavor is amazing."
5146,FOOD#POSITIVE,There are over 500 items to choose from.
5147,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I did think they did great when it came to a variety of small plate dishes, but dang not worth the price."
5148,FOOD#POSITIVE,I wanted to walk over to some tables and take pictures of their food too!
5149,FOOD#POSITIVE,It was expensive around the holidays ($50\/person) but had every meat dish you could imagine.
5150,FOOD#POSITIVE,But the one other thing that I really enjoy here is their cooking station during gourmet dinners.
5151,FOOD#POSITIVE,the crisp rice was good but very heavy on the lemon grass which over powered the dish but was still good.
5152,FOOD#POSITIVE,The Asian food was really delicious.
5153,FOOD#POSITIVE,I love hot sandwiches and this place is really good if you want food quickly in Vegas.
5154,FOOD#POSITIVE,The dessert bar has a wide selection.
5155,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The $29 brunch seemed a bit pricey to me, but I was willing to pay for it given the quality of the food."
5156,FOOD#POSITIVE,If you are on the verge of starving this is the perfect destination because all the portions were unbelievably huge as in me and my boyfriend could have been stuffed on just my plate alone and the prices are moderate so it really was amazing.
5157,FOOD#POSITIVE,"We had a carafe of the Frangria, which was delicious husband had the chicken brie sandwich that was delicious, and I had the Pate and salad which were both great."
5158,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The breakfast menu offers a great selection, ranging from cereal and fruit to pancakes and waffles, egg dishes, and crepes."
5159,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Cutely presented, little tiny buns with a peice of meat and carrots, etc."
5160,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Bacchanal has easily the biggest seafood options out of all the buffet restaurants in The Strip, ranging from oysters to mussels, clams, crab legs, crab claws, lobster bisque, etc."
5161,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The areas of the buffet had well seasoned fishes, shrimp cocktail , fruit that was fresh and ripe, lots of sides that looked good but I wanted meat, sweets and such."
5162,FOOD#POSITIVE,I just wish I had a bigger stomach so I could try everything.
5163,FOOD#POSITIVE,"carinavore:
a good variety of meats including lamb, prime rib, chicken wellington (YUM!)."
5164,FOOD#POSITIVE,This place delivers on the food in an exciting and bold way.
5165,FOOD#POSITIVE,"On previous trips I have had the grilled cheese sandwich, which is amazing, but HUGE."
5166,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The selection was pretty decent, the creativity wasn't there like you would get at Wicked Spoon but at the end I always racked up too many little bowls and dishes at WS."
5167,FOOD#POSITIVE,The mango was very good.
5168,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Good food, but overpriced  The wait is long during peak hours, but that is to be expected for most buffets in Vegas."
5169,FOOD#POSITIVE,"You do pay more since it is a higher end buffet, but I think its worth it because of  the variety  of the selection and quality of food."
5170,FOOD#POSITIVE,This is an upscale place and the food was more single serving than buffet quality.
5171,FOOD#POSITIVE,Food was excellent.
5172,FOOD#POSITIVE,There are enough options to go more than once and still have many new and interesting things to sample.
5173,FOOD#POSITIVE,We were looking for a vegetarian friendly buffet place and this place had lot of positive reviews for being vegetarian friendly so we decided to check it out.
5174,FOOD#POSITIVE,It was a very great deal and a very good sandwich!
5175,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I tried the following for dinner:

King crab legs
Seared salmon with capers
Cooked shrimp in grits
Pork tenderloin at the grill
Korean BBQ beef ribs
Mini burger
Fried calamari
Shoyu ramen
Parmesan risotto
Sauteed greens
Sweet potato
Macarons
Vanilla gelato
Chocolate mousse with berries 
Chcolate covered strawberries

Every serving was insanely delicious and dazzled my taste buds!"
5176,FOOD#POSITIVE,But what I really love was the Mexican section!
5177,FOOD#POSITIVE,The best sandwiches are the ones with roast beef and\/or chicken.
5178,FOOD#POSITIVE,"More selection, nicer ambiance, better quality."
5179,FOOD#POSITIVE,Enjoyed the breakfast fare.
5180,FOOD#POSITIVE,I would stick with the Northern Thai specialties or ask your server what they like.
5181,FOOD#POSITIVE,Man there was so much good food.
5182,FOOD#POSITIVE,The quantity of desserts and their quality is really impressive!
5183,FOOD#POSITIVE,But the sandwiches more than exceeded my expectations.
5184,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Sandwiches are tops and at $6-7 a pop, it's very reasonable."
5185,FOOD#POSITIVE,"It ranges from standard fare like roast beef, lamb and fried chicken, to salads, seafood, and a smattering of Asian inspired offerings to appeal to the rather large number of Chinese patrons."
5186,FOOD#POSITIVE,"It is all so exciting, but apparently what they have that many other Thai places don't is Northern Thai cuisine and a killer riesling menu."
5187,FOOD#POSITIVE,I had done some research online about restaurants offering gluten free options near Bally's Hotel and Casino.
5188,FOOD#POSITIVE,I spent like 2 hours here eating a good variety of foods.
5189,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I really liked the balance of flavors so I think the other noodle dishes will be good, too."
5190,FOOD#POSITIVE,I don't think I've ever had terrible creme brulee and Mon Ami Gabi's definitely didn't disappoint either.
5191,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There were omlettes, eggs benedict, waffles, french toast, pancakes, bacon, sausage, and other breakfast things you might expect."
5192,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The prices were good for Vegas and the meal was accompanied by wine, a decent chocolate mousse and coffee at the end."
5193,FOOD#POSITIVE,The potato gratin with white truffle was to die for.
5194,FOOD#POSITIVE,I couldn't believe all the dishes I tried were really good.
5195,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food was great but now as good as the people watching:) 
I woke up this morning to look in the review journal to see mon ami gabi recieved a c rating from the health district........maybe would have thought twice about the oysters and tuna tartar knowing this."
5196,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They also had all the other typical brunch things: waffles, french toast, eggs benedict, etc."
5197,FOOD#POSITIVE,We went for brunch\/lunch but the selection and food was still so good.
5198,FOOD#POSITIVE,"there are so many options, i got way too flustered for ""round one"" and came back with half a plateful of crab legs and two slices of watermelon."
5199,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Everything looked delicious, service was supeb."
5200,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Since it is a French place, I decided to branch out from my usual eggs benedict to try out the chicken and apple crepe... Great choice!"
5201,FOOD#POSITIVE,The desserts are especially good for a buffet and there's a full gelato bar.
5202,FOOD#POSITIVE,"This buffet is popular for their dessert which was great and had a ton of varieties, but their main food was disappointing."
5203,FOOD#POSITIVE,Burgers: Good but not amazing.
5204,FOOD#POSITIVE,I've never seen such a variety of desserts in one place at the same time!
5205,FOOD#POSITIVE,"As a person who usually goes to cheap buffets, I was impressed with the selection of food (main course, salad, and dessert) they have."
5206,FOOD#POSITIVE,Pancakes that are excessive in size but that you can't stop eating.
5207,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They offer some higher end ingredients including: truffle, bone marrow, grab legs among some others."
5208,FOOD#POSITIVE,Stick with the sweets.
5209,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food looks great, but when you take that first bite the food is eh..."
5210,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I was a little disappointed that they raised prices, but given the high quality of the food offerred at this buffet, it's okay."
5211,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Gourmet Sandwiches

24 Hours

Decant Prices

Fantastic!"
5212,FOOD#POSITIVE,There was a Mexican station that had nice make your own tacos and tortilla chips.
5213,FOOD#POSITIVE,Again great spot for quick grab and go food :)
5214,FOOD#POSITIVE,I truly recommend this place if you want to try some different cuisines at the same time.
5215,FOOD#POSITIVE,Everyone said that they liked the food and the presentation was great!
5216,FOOD#POSITIVE,Highly recommend the crab legs as well as the pasta station and you can't leave without taking a few trips around the desserts.
5217,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food is consistantly delicious and the staff is awesome.
5218,FOOD#POSITIVE,If you want to try some interesting mixes of flavors this place can offer you some.
5219,FOOD#POSITIVE,It cut with just my fork and felt like butter melting in my mouth!
5220,FOOD#POSITIVE,I have eaten there three times and faced the same problem... great food but difficult to get to it.
5221,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I'm sure the other ""generic"" thai dishes are good but their specialties were out of this world."
5222,FOOD#POSITIVE,"With over 500 dishes to choose from and 15 chef specials that change daily, dishes are prepared in an open kitchen concept for customers to see."
5223,FOOD#POSITIVE,Best French toast ever and interesting desserts.
5224,FOOD#POSITIVE,Excellent food and above and beyond service.
5225,FOOD#POSITIVE,The portions are HUGE and the prices are reasonable.
5226,FOOD#POSITIVE,"We are vegetarians they have plenty of choices covering nice flavors from Asia,  Italy and the American palate."
5227,FOOD#POSITIVE,"If you like it hot, you gotta get your butt over to Lotus of Siam :)

The food is amazing."
5228,FOOD#POSITIVE,The Italian & the Mexican kitchens both had some wonderful wonderful dishes I never got to try.
5229,FOOD#POSITIVE,the perfect amount of greasiness and spiciness.
5230,FOOD#POSITIVE,"However, Hash House A Go Go is well known for the huge portions and a filling, satisfying meal."
5231,FOOD#POSITIVE,It's crowded because it's an affordable and delicious breakfast spot.
5232,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They have different ethnic cuisines, including tons of meats and seafood galore."
5233,FOOD#POSITIVE,the food is wonderful and TABLE service is great.
5234,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Everyone really enjoyed the food, the setting and the service."
5235,FOOD#POSITIVE,Food was terrific.
5236,FOOD#POSITIVE,I only wish I had saved room to sample from the massive gelato display.
5237,FOOD#POSITIVE,The service lacks alittle but the food is well worth waiting for.
5238,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There was food from every genre imaginable and even indian dishes, which is rare for any regular buffet."
5239,FOOD#POSITIVE,"(I'm kinda drooling thinking about this right now..) 
-Fresh juice (from the juice bar, not the menu you order from the waiters): You can definitely tell they are made from real fruits !"
5240,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Unfortunately, the 4 of us could barely get through 2 plates because they gave us SO much food."
5241,FOOD#POSITIVE,finally - good food in las vegas!
5242,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Healthy portions all around, good stuff!"
5243,FOOD#POSITIVE,"You have choices of Middle eastern food, American, Italian and Chinese\/Japanese with some deserts."
5244,FOOD#POSITIVE,Each servings is in a small container or miniature parts.which is very cute and unique idea for a buffet.
5245,FOOD#POSITIVE,I could only imagine how awesome the dinner selection is.
5246,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I wish the milkshake was thicker or kept more chilled, but overall the milkshakes we ordered at our table were amazing (5\/5)."
5247,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The main attraction for me was the king crab, which can easily be $25-35 per pound in the stores."
5248,FOOD#POSITIVE,"We are not talking about some poorly copied Subway knockoff, we are talking about a quaint little store, filled with personality, AND filled to the brim with people enjoying their customized, fresh, made in front of you sandwiches."
5249,FOOD#POSITIVE,This buffet doesn't end!
5250,FOOD#POSITIVE,Good service with interesting varieties of delicious food.
5251,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Husband and I both ordered a burger, however we shared fries which was good because the portion was huge."
5252,FOOD#POSITIVE,Great variety and portions of food.
5253,FOOD#POSITIVE,Just not very vegetarian friendly unless you like eating a boring cheese sandwich.
5254,FOOD#POSITIVE,"While it is all you can eat, I ended up getting full pretty quickly and wasn't able to try all the food items I wanted to."
5255,FOOD#POSITIVE,The eggs benedict is basically the size of your face.
5256,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Their small dish concept works pretty good, but walking back to your chair with all these small dishes balanced on your plate is pretty entertaining."
5257,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There were a few parts of the buffet that I liked, like that they had crab legs for lunch and the brisket and the service."
5258,FOOD#POSITIVE,I just know I came out here as a happy camper with food coma lol.
5259,FOOD#POSITIVE,"https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=cUN0Y7kBx34p_nOM_C6XJQ&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA

Steak Frites with Bearnaise- The steak had great flavor with a unique garlic flavor I never had with steak frites before but it worked."
5260,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There's the usual crab legs, Chinese food, sushi, meat station but then there's the taco bar, noodle bar, dim sum, Spanish food and so much more."
5261,FOOD#POSITIVE,Some of the items were small like bagels but for good reason too many other things to try!
5262,FOOD#POSITIVE,The avocado definitely help balance the jalapeno.
5263,FOOD#POSITIVE,They had sugar free options and healthier choices.
5264,FOOD#POSITIVE,They had macaroons that rivaled the quality in some French bakeries I've visited--and six different kinds!
5265,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Moving from there, the dessert options were varied and huge."
5266,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There was a wonderful assortment of good quality, fresh food and next time we are in Vegas we will definitely be back!"
5267,FOOD#POSITIVE,"For the most part, they are all good."
5268,FOOD#POSITIVE,There is a wide selection of quality food.
5269,FOOD#POSITIVE,Their Asian cuisine has drunken noddles served in cute Chinese takeout boxes.
5270,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The portions here are pretty good, but the quality of the food is mediocre and definitely not up to par with their prices."
5271,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I had a bite of everyone's food and shakes and will just say that if the food we ordered tasted was that amazing, I can only imagine what the rest of the menu tastes like!!!!"
5272,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Wait is a bit long, but you can always take turns with your friends and gamble while you wait :) the meat selections are heavenly and never disappoints"
5273,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I had the full montagu and it hit the spot, perfect size sandwich but I think you can easily eat two if you really wanted to."
5274,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Earl and your club....you are my long distant lover, till we meet again..."
5275,FOOD#POSITIVE,"EXCELLENT buffet :)

The only part of the buffet that I didn't quite enjoy was the Asian selection...but hey...the rest of it made up for it all the way!"
5276,FOOD#POSITIVE,I'm not a huge fan of meat and eating bread is probably the last thing I need to be doing but my boyfriends sandwich selection was definitely the type of sandwich that makes you say hot damn!
5277,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Amazing view of the fountains, outside patio with mists and a nice breakfast selection."
5278,FOOD#POSITIVE,"While they didn't have snow crab during brunch (my go to at buffets), the variety of other delicious dishes more than compensated."
5279,FOOD#POSITIVE,and their wine list is so extensive for a thai restaurant!
5280,FOOD#POSITIVE,Great deal for delicious food in giant portions!
5281,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The dessert section had ice cream, little cakes, panna cotta, a lovely passion fruit cake, croissanta, donuts, chocolate covered strawberries, and more."
5282,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food was good for a buffet but nothing more.
5283,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food is ENDLESS.
5284,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The menu looks very appetizing and I have to say that I very much enjoyed the ""Gooey Fries"" (melted cheese, ham, and an egg sunny side up)."
5285,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Had the Salmon Benedict, the first one was amazing."
5286,FOOD#POSITIVE,"However, the Pad See Ew at Lotus of Siam wasn't greasy at all, with the perfect balance of sauce."
5287,FOOD#POSITIVE,Delicious food and solid service.
5288,FOOD#POSITIVE,They have all Thai classics at a standard Thai restaurant price and trust me  you don't JUST come here for the pad Thai and Tom yum.
5289,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Located on the second floor of Imperial Palace which is a random spot to be, HH is place you should defintely check out if you want some good food and want to avoid buffets."
5290,FOOD#POSITIVE,"However, they are cooked well!"
5291,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Worth the wait, this place had amazing portions that most mortals could not finish."
5292,FOOD#POSITIVE,"After initially stuffing my face, I took a lap around the place, lots of stations, too numerous to describe, but seafood, chinese food, meat carving stations, pots of stuff with sauce, etc and a giant dessert station."
5293,FOOD#POSITIVE,"However, it provided some unique items as well such sushi\/Asian, tacos, and various fish dishes."
5294,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Great, great quality."
5295,FOOD#POSITIVE,Thinking about it makes me want to drive up to Vegas right now just for the burgers.
5296,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Dinner is the most expensive but has the best food, take advantage of the seafood, although their might be a line by the seafood station it is definetely worth it if you paid for the dinner."
5297,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Very quick, good food, good wines, and your final bill will be much lower than other restaurants right on the Strip
The outdoor patio is all the rage but you will probably have to wait for a while
Indoor seating is very nice and not too noisy"
5298,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Pros:
- Trip Tip, Ribs, Soft Tacos, Seafood, Steam crab legs (Snow Crabs, not king crab though)
- A good variety Desserts, Mochi ice cream (seasonal)
- Fresh oysters
- Good Chinese food selection (I like the thousand year old egg porridge)
- Delicious Coffee

Cons: 
- No King Crab Legs (Bellagio's Buffet has king crab legs)
- No Caviar (Bellagio has this)


Overall - I think the food quality is a notch better than Bellagio's Buffet and right on par with Wynn"
5299,FOOD#POSITIVE,"It was incredible, and it did its job of getting us all pretty buzzed and chowing down on tons of food."
5300,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I'm not talking about a shop that sells sweet and sour pork, pork fried rice, adds pad thai on the menu, and calls them self a Thai Restaurant."
5301,FOOD#POSITIVE,I found myself in a crazy food coma after this meal.
5302,FOOD#POSITIVE,Really great choice of food and I am sure that every taste is covered.
5303,FOOD#POSITIVE,It has the greatest variety of delicious foods and I love their fresh juices and beautiful desserts.
5304,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I love the food here, and for Vegas central strip, the price is awesome for what you get."
5305,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Lots of options, but the food was average."
5306,FOOD#POSITIVE,This would be a place for people who like to take pictures of their food because of the presentation but do not want to pay $100 for a la carte`.
5307,FOOD#POSITIVE,They served it to me in a pizza box since it was the only container large enough to hold everything!
5308,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Do yourselves a favor and go to Firefly Tapas Kitchen for one hell of a meal, service, vegan\/vegetarian\/meat eater options and drinks!"
5309,FOOD#POSITIVE,I enjoyed every single dish!
5310,FOOD#POSITIVE,You'll find items here that you are likely to find on a 5 star menu and they don't taste mass produced.
5311,FOOD#POSITIVE,Maintains presentation - consistency in plating technique is a 3.5\/5 - 4\/5 depending on the station & dish.
5312,FOOD#POSITIVE,"At the Mexican food station, there were several types of salsa, hot sauces, and guacamole for eggs, which I thought was great."
5313,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I can't begin to tell you about the intense, endless variety of food available at this buffet."
5314,FOOD#POSITIVE,One of the best burgers in Vegas for sure!
5315,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Buffeten bugner af alt hvad hjertet begærer; over 300 forskellige retter, 70 dessert-items (inkl en masse sukkerfrie muligheder), 9 forskellige spændende gelatos, friskpressede juicer, hummer og skaldyr, sushi, pizza, brød, osv osv osv."
5316,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They did have a cute little peking duck bun station that was nice, although the server was never around."
5317,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Tried several things, but the best two dishes we've tried are the garlic prawns and the khao soi."
5318,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food here is reasonably priced with huge portions that only I seem to finish when I go with my friends.
5319,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They have a huge variety of food, so I didn't even have time to get through all of it, but the sushi and meats were pretty tasty, especially for a buffet."
5320,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The sundae was good, but it definitely doesn't make up for the horrendous service."
5321,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Either way, the selection of food is always good."
5322,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Food was excellent for breakfast, I had the smoked salmon eggs benedict."
5323,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Even though the initial wait was long and our server wasn't the best (for quite some time we didn't even know who our server was), it doesn't ruin the quality of service we received from everyone else or the quality of food!"
5324,FOOD#POSITIVE,Really don't know where the negative comments came from but honestly I think the price and food are worth it.
5325,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Their filet mignon with their house merlot butter is delicious and amazing and only $35 (cheap for the strip), so is their house Cabernet I also LOVE their french onion soup best french onion soup in town."
5326,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Burgers - Per our server's recommendation, I had the Farm burger (duck bacon, cheddar, fried egg) and it was amazing."
5327,FOOD#POSITIVE,"If only my stomach could devoured it all, I would if I could."
5328,FOOD#POSITIVE,"excessive amounts instead of quality

tough choice, food was a little bit better than average, the overall service was way less than standard and the atmosphere was not good."
5329,FOOD#POSITIVE,"With what seems like an endless array of delicious food, Bacchanal comes out on top simply because of the quality AND quantity it serves."
5330,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Most of the pieces were really tender, but the dish overall was bland, although the curry was good."
5331,FOOD#POSITIVE,(There menu is very expansive and I would like to try other items).
5332,FOOD#POSITIVE,"SALADS\/ASIAN STATION-The Watermelon and Feta Salad was good, and the Tonkotsu Ramen was pretty good for being at a buffet ."
5333,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Must try the waffle, it takes a little while to make, but it definitely hits the spot."
5334,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Everything is portioned controlled, for the post part, things are served in individual plates, dishes like Red Snapper to Baked Salmon... things like Potatoes Al Gratin are neat little single serve plates."
5335,FOOD#POSITIVE,They are served in small individual tin pots which helps with portion control.
5336,FOOD#POSITIVE,I liked the long line layout of the food.
5337,FOOD#POSITIVE,"From the custom Mac and Cheese bar, to risotto, to scallops, prawn cocktails, roast meat section, Korean BBQ section, make your own Ramen noodles, Sushi and not to mention the amazing desserts."
5338,FOOD#POSITIVE,As a chef this is a for sure hit and a great way to experiment with your food.
5339,FOOD#POSITIVE,I usually judge a buffet by its seafood options and this one did not disappoint.
5340,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I can get a foot long at Subway for $5, but the taste of the sandwiches makes up for the cost and are probably proportionate portion sizes for what we should all eat for a sandwich."
5341,FOOD#POSITIVE,The portions are very big so it's easy to share.
5342,FOOD#POSITIVE,I chose to forgo the meats line in favor of the myriad of other cuisines that were available.
5343,FOOD#POSITIVE,The portions are massive - so be prepared and come with an appetite or bring home leftovers.
5344,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There's a crap load of dessert options, but they look better than they taste and was a disappointment."
5345,FOOD#POSITIVE,Who would have thought you could buy a very good $7 meal on the strip in Vegas?
5346,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I also got to taste the tuna salad and Jerk Chicken sandwich.. More or less, everything was excellent and we drunkenly made our way back to the Jockey Club well satisfied and ready for bed..

All hail the Earl of Sandwich!"
5347,FOOD#POSITIVE,The huge portions coupled with tasty food and reasonable pricing definitely sets this place apart.
5348,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food here is your typical american fare but with their own twists on it...and the portions are good enough for 2-3 people.
5349,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The presentation and plating at this buffet were great, although most of the food looked better than it tasted."
5350,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The apple butter paired perfectly but again, I wish my food was HOT."
5351,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Also, I have to note that part of the joy of the mac and cheese and fried chicken (aside from the fact that, hello, it's mac and cheese and fried chicken) were the dishes that they came in."
5352,FOOD#POSITIVE,"there are 2 reasons i am giving this place 3 stars:
  1. food was good."
5353,FOOD#POSITIVE,:) there not stingy with their food like other places .
5354,FOOD#POSITIVE,They do have a lot of items not available at other Thai restaurants.
5355,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Size wise.. it's not a large sandwich, and if you're super hungry get two, but honestly I think the size is good."
5356,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Overall, my expectations were too high but this is still a good buffet... so many choices and so many things I didn't get to try."
5357,FOOD#POSITIVE,Since I didn't know which sauce I wanted to accompany my steak Matt (server) offer to bring three.
5358,FOOD#POSITIVE,Baked Cheese and Chicken Liver Mousse were both excellent appetizers!
5359,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Stations include: a large dessert area with gelato, cookies, pastries, and chocolate covered strawberries; Asian station with tender Korean story short rib, freshly rolled sushi, and typical Chinese and Asian fare; a fresh fruit, cheeses, salads, and bread station; a live action station that serves custom order mac and cheese for dinner and omelets for brunch; a seafood and fish station; a Latin cuisine influenced section; and  an Italian pizza and pasta station that features delicious gnocchi, smoked ham infused macaroni and cheese, and butternut squash ravioli to die for."
5360,FOOD#POSITIVE,Food selection and service were great.
5361,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I hate the dessert version of this dish, but this was awesome."
5362,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I LOVED the italian section, though, especially the flat pizza."
5363,FOOD#POSITIVE,Im glad I ate here because of the experience and variety but not sure if I would go back.
5364,FOOD#POSITIVE,There was a nice variety of desserts though nothing really caught my eye.
5365,FOOD#POSITIVE,This place was WAY better then most of food we had while in Vegas.
5366,FOOD#POSITIVE,"After tackling this heavy meal, the tap water wasn't so bad at all."
5367,FOOD#POSITIVE,I give Wicked Spoon the credit for food presentation but the food didn't taste as fresh.
5368,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I know most buffets serve significantly worse food than their a-la-carte items, but this is not one of those buffets."
5369,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The dishes are presented like a plated meal, unlike your typical buffet where you just slap all the selections on your plate into a mound of indistinguishable grub."
5370,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Foods on that buffet include (but are not limited to): salami, proscuitto, olives, cheddar cheese, jack cheese, swiss cheese, BYObruschetta, fresh juices, chicken noodle, tomato, french onion soups, rigatoni, spaghetti, lobster frittatta, turkey, ham, bacon, more bacon sliced off a slab of bacon, egg whites, scrambled eggs, an omelette station, migas, a pancake station, pizza (four kinds), lox, bagels, sushi, dumplings, pork buns, thai chicken wings, beans, rice, tacos, profiteroles, eclairs, gelato (20 kinds), pie, custards, tarts, cookies, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, more bacon and a salad bar (which no one touched.)"
5371,FOOD#POSITIVE,The lunch buffet ran about $30 but there's a great selection of food.
5372,FOOD#POSITIVE,"This place is very good,  If you love french food, your going to love this place."
5373,FOOD#POSITIVE,the chicken was delicious no wonder the rave reviews and the flapjack was GINORMOUS and off-the- chain yummy!!
5374,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Lots to choose from and very tasty, fresh food!"
5375,FOOD#POSITIVE,The desert bar is a treat of its own with amazing gelato flavors and a seemingly endless variety of chocolate delights.
5376,FOOD#POSITIVE,Solid tasty sandwiches at good prices.
5377,FOOD#POSITIVE,They also offer Asian cuisine such as Chinese and Japanese.
5378,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I love this place, food is great and the desserts are the best!"
5379,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Carving station is minimal, serving two items, but the Teriyaki marinated flank steak was done perfectly."
5380,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The Buffet also offered imitation beef tacos for lunch, so always ask!"
5381,FOOD#POSITIVE,"What was exceptional was the lobster frittata, pepper jack hash brown cakes, the granola French toast, and the most amazing dessert buffet that I have ever seen!"
5382,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Yes, it is organized and there are a lot of options."
5383,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food is solid, but the service is spectacular."
5384,FOOD#POSITIVE,For $27 per adult it was an incredible meal.
5385,FOOD#POSITIVE,"And even though I am not typically a dessert or sweets person, I could not resist the decadent array of mini desserts...the creme brûlée melted in my mouth along with a vegan passion fruit mousse and a raspberry chocolate confection...mmmm...at $25.99 for lunch, you can't beat the value and experience...."
5386,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Moist, rich, but not too rich, and just the right amount of deliciousness in a tiny, sugar-free square."
5387,FOOD#POSITIVE,"For desserts, they had a crepe chef, shaved ice (delicious house\/custom flavors) and gelato as well as various cupcakes, cheese cakes and other small plates of incredible gastronomy."
5388,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The desserts section was so beautifully set up, I even ended up taking photos of it."
5389,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I tried so many different items that I can't list them all, but nothing really stood out to me to be honest."
5390,FOOD#POSITIVE,"My experiences at buffets have proven that quantity compromises quality, which tends to result in an abundance of mediocre food."
5391,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There were mini sliders, street tacos, pastas, crab legs, shrimp, pizza, beef short ribs, a carving station with almost any type of fresh meat, and I could go on & on!!!"
5392,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food was more than I expected it to be and I had very high expectations.
5393,FOOD#POSITIVE,They definitely had more unique dishes than your average Vegas Buffet.
5394,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Presentation - 5.0
Flavors - 4.75
Service - 4.75
Speed - 4.0
Ambiance - 4.5

The servers, all attractive, wear short blue or gray skirts with matching top."
5395,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Chicken liver pate - 4\/5 - the liver spread was very flavorful and generous size 
Mussels - 3\/5 - decent sized mussel, strong onion flavors but it still had a strong oceanic taste  
Ribeye- 3\/5 - this thing was huge!!!"
5396,FOOD#POSITIVE,The variety is spot on.
5397,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Smores Mocha: Snooping through previous Yelp photos at HHAGG, I found this delicious mess of a concoction and decided to order it to share with everyone, which by the way was a great call because the mug was H U G E. The whole fam passed it around and we still didn't finish it."
5398,FOOD#POSITIVE,Will come back again but to share a burger and get the bao puns as the guy next to me had them & they looked so good!
5399,FOOD#POSITIVE,"When you walk around the little dessert section it doesn't look like much, but I filled up two plates just taking one of each thing, and I didn't touch the gelatos."
5400,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The service is nice, the security is cool and most important, the food is great!"
5401,FOOD#POSITIVE,Food is amazing!
5402,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Aside from the flat sodas, the food overall is really good."
5403,FOOD#POSITIVE,"This is definitely the best burger place I've been to so far food-wise, but be warned: don't come here when you're starving because the wait (both for a table and then for the actual food to come) will probably make you faint."
5404,FOOD#POSITIVE,The atmosphere is nothing to write home about but the service and food is perfect.
5405,FOOD#POSITIVE,"And the chipotle cream they used wasn't quite what I expected, given my experience with many a eggs benedict, but it suited the chicken and eggs very well."
5406,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Their sandwiches  are delicious, the service is quick, and the food is very reasonably priced, too (only $5.99 for a sandwich)."
5407,FOOD#POSITIVE,The lobster chowder soup was a bit sweeter than expected but everything else at the seafood station was top notch.
5408,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The menu offers a wide range of burgers (and other non-burger offerings, but they are totally besides the point), from the traditional American (American cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion) to the Farm Burger (duck bacon, cheddar, fried egg) to the Euro Burger (goat cheese, truffle aioli, arugula, and an oven-roasted tomato)."
5409,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food is great, a large selection of comfort foods, all taste great."
5410,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Our entire experience at the Wicked Spoon was top notch, from the welcoming staff to the excellent food choices, to the ambience."
5411,FOOD#POSITIVE,Food was very delicious.
5412,FOOD#POSITIVE,Restaurant itself was beautiful and presentation was cute with the little pots and things like that.
5413,FOOD#POSITIVE,Each bite is love.
5414,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Tons of seafood options - fresh oysters, crab legs, ceviche, oyster shooter , crawfish."
5415,FOOD#POSITIVE,Pad thai option on the Buffet wasnt that good however the pasta choices were great.
5416,FOOD#POSITIVE,"the outside area is really nice, and the view is wonderful."
5417,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Obviously, it's a nice french restaurant and the service and food are top notch."
5418,FOOD#POSITIVE,Wow this buffet had everything.
5419,FOOD#POSITIVE,We devoured all of it.
5420,FOOD#POSITIVE,"It's a buffet, an upscale one with a vast selection of food."
5421,FOOD#POSITIVE,I also love the fact that I can get some non breakfast food at 8:00 am.
5422,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Delicious French food, AND gluten-free options?!?!"
5423,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Excellent service, extensive selection of wines by the glass, good food (especially the sides) and if you're sitting by the window or outside you'll catch a great view of Bellagio's water show."
5424,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The Asian food is spectacular, my personal favorite section is the front where they have the comfort classics, fried chicken, mac n cheese, mashed potatoe, cream corn and stuff like that."
5425,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Desserts: My wifey loves her desserts and there were so many options to choose from... Cakes, macaroons, ice cream, ice cream cookie sandwiches, basically everything.. Basically, top selling items from well known dessert places all put together."
5426,FOOD#POSITIVE,"This is not the fanciest steakhouse you'll find in Vegas, but the food is delicious."
5427,FOOD#POSITIVE,Vegetarians pretty much have one option for a main course.
5428,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Like most buffets there are a variety of sections such as salad, meat, seafood, and dessert."
5429,FOOD#POSITIVE,Never had this money food and drinks at the same time.
5430,FOOD#POSITIVE,I love the small plates of food.
5431,FOOD#POSITIVE,Definitely one of dee BEST food that I ever ate in my life!
5432,FOOD#POSITIVE,They also had a huge dessert bar with an excellent selection.
5433,FOOD#POSITIVE,The pork was delicious and had a very good mouth feel.
5434,FOOD#POSITIVE,There are other buffets that cost few dollars less but their food is much better and less salty.
5435,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Cornish game hen - I believe it's adobe glazed and fantasticly soft 5.5 stars if possible

Bacon chipotle pasta - I try not to eat carbs here, but it was really, really good

Coconut curry\/mustard (some yellow sauce) sea bass - sea bass is expensive and oh so soft and melt in your mouth, amazing

apple glazed salmon - not bad, not amazing though, stick with the sea bass

I don't care for Alaskan king crab legs (they're HUGE) or sushi, but all my friends got plate loads of this."
5436,FOOD#POSITIVE,It was very soft and had a slight creamy taste to it.
5437,FOOD#POSITIVE,There's an endless amount of items and no matter how hungry I am I never really feel like I've gotten my money's worth.
5438,FOOD#POSITIVE,My man vs food plate was a great show dish.
5439,FOOD#POSITIVE,Just a sandwich place that's good and cheaper than most Vegas places.
5440,FOOD#POSITIVE,"As others say, this is really at the top tier of breakfasts in Vegas."
5441,FOOD#POSITIVE,I like the way some of the items are presented allowing you to taste many of the items they provide.
5442,FOOD#POSITIVE,"And unlike the Paris and Wynn buffets, Wicked Spoon actually executes a good amount of these dishes well!"
5443,FOOD#POSITIVE,Safe to say the best Thai food I've ever had.
5444,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food was amazing, but the timing and service of our meal were executed poorly."
5445,FOOD#POSITIVE,The thing I didn't like about eating at a buffet was that somehow the restaurant wouldn't look good as they would focus more on the buffet\/food rather than the atmosphere.
5446,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I did manage to save a little room for dessert and really enjoyed that station, and I am not a big dessert person."
5447,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Everything was tasty, especially the bone marrow and pork belly."
5448,FOOD#POSITIVE,It is one of their most popular dishes and looked pretty amazing.
5449,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I had 5 full plates of food including sushi, cookies, roasted vegetables, marinated olives, and sooo much more!"
5450,FOOD#POSITIVE,"While sushi from a sushi restaurant is always better, the sushi selection here was good compared to the sushi that I have tried at other buffets."
5451,FOOD#POSITIVE,Overall--wide selection of food.
5452,FOOD#POSITIVE,Food portions are huge.
5453,FOOD#POSITIVE,"They don't serve your food on a plate, they serve it on a big platter!!"
5454,FOOD#POSITIVE,Their desserts section was on the opposite side of the buffet but the sweet confections were to die for!
5455,FOOD#POSITIVE,imho every single type of cuisine is done very well here at Bacchanal.
5456,FOOD#POSITIVE,They have an assortment of cheese and bread.
5457,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Four kinds of ceviche, gourmet salads served in elegant glasses, chicken panang prepared as you like it, a bountiful heaping of preserved meats and cheeses, a generous selection of Indian cuisine, lamb prepared three of four different ways, rare prime rib and juicy plump sausage and tender veal, steamed Chinese pork buns and crispy wontons (no thanks), mounds of crab legs and a variety of smoked fish, pasta made to order (also no thanks)...and those were just the entrees."
5458,FOOD#POSITIVE,This buffet has a large selection of all different types of cuisine.
5459,FOOD#POSITIVE,The food was awesome...HUGE portions!
5460,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I would rather have less selection, but high quality food."
5461,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Oh yeah, I like weekend lunch because there's breakfast food and bottomless champagne or mimosa for like $5 extra."
5462,FOOD#POSITIVE,Good burger and great drinks.
5463,FOOD#POSITIVE,We made multiple stops here during our trip as there was plenty to try!
5464,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The atmosphere was lovely, the staff was great and the food was pretty good."
5465,FOOD#POSITIVE,Lotus of Siam has amazing food and a wine selection to rival most fine Italian restaurants and steakhouses.
5466,FOOD#POSITIVE,And my favorite section was dessert.
5467,FOOD#POSITIVE,"chop, pork ribs, beef rib, and especially prime rib (as good as Lawrys) get an A.

Chinese, charcuterie, street tacos, and to a lesser extent, Italian section were all quite good."
5468,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Great variety, lovely atmosphere and good food."
5469,FOOD#POSITIVE,"It has everything you can imagine, from Chinese to sushi..Mexican, Italian, huge salad & cheese bar to the different varieties of meats & my personal favorite the seafood selection."
5470,FOOD#POSITIVE,Anyway we will probably be back because it is pretty good for deserts and we've been other times and the service has been okay.
5471,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The quality of the food is superior, and I highly recommend going to this buffet."
5472,FOOD#POSITIVE,"All the sandwiches are just as good though, including The Original 1762 and The Earl's Club."
5473,FOOD#POSITIVE,enjoy a drink and tasty food while seeing he town and the cleintel it brings in.
5474,FOOD#POSITIVE,I would definitely eat their desserts here again but next time bring more people!
5475,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Bacchanal is probably a good bet for the chronically undecided, those with fussy children, or those with enormous appetites."
5476,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Then there's the cold seafood section with crab, shrimp, oysters, everything."
5477,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The restaurant is beautifully decorated and the food, oh my...the food was unbelievable."
5478,FOOD#POSITIVE,I think the variety and quality is tops in the world of AYCE buffet options.
5479,FOOD#POSITIVE,I ate some fruits which made me happy - it's hard to get fresh fruits in Vegas restaurants.
5480,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I like this place very much, great customer service, great view, and amazing food."
5481,FOOD#POSITIVE,Their desserts have great options (except fresh fruit they need more) Definitely beats the Bellagio!
5482,FOOD#POSITIVE,Everything looked good and there SEEMED like a lot of variety available.
5483,FOOD#POSITIVE,They do however have the most food selection out of all the other buffets but the food quality isn't that great.
5484,FOOD#POSITIVE,Wicked Spoon offers a nice variety of options and has some cute touches that distinguish it from other buffets.
5485,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The more stuff I put on my plate, the more it looked like an actual dish a nice restaurant would serve."
5486,FOOD#POSITIVE,The presentation was quite nice and the food itself was a solid 3 stars.
5487,FOOD#POSITIVE,I really liked the sandwich.
5488,FOOD#POSITIVE,"For example, I had the crab eggs benedict during the Brunch hour."
5489,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I am a huge fan of good burgers, and the chefs at this Gordon Ramsay restaurant sure know how to make a good burger."
5490,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The price is very reasonable for the exquisite
Food and the spectacular view of the strip at night."
5491,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Amazing Thai food, plenty of seating, and great service."
5492,FOOD#POSITIVE,The foods unbelievable (for a buffet).
5493,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Wicked Spoon has an array of food ranging from American, Mexican, Italian, & Asian."
5494,FOOD#POSITIVE,"THE GOOD NEWS is that my boyfriend really liked the food, service was alright and that was very important to me."
5495,FOOD#POSITIVE,I would venture that it's the only place on the strip where you can have such a great view and good food at such a reasonable price.
5496,FOOD#POSITIVE,"With the presentation, I thought it was going to be SO DELICIOUS, but on the contrary it was below par."
5497,FOOD#POSITIVE,Also a great selection of beers on tap.
5498,FOOD#POSITIVE,"While the food was fantastic, the quality of service was nowhere near where it should be for a restaurant of this caliber and the great food was not enough to overcome the horrendous service."
5499,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The food at  this buffet is very good, plus they have some tasty treats that you normally don't find at a buffet...so you can expand your taste horizons."
5500,FOOD#POSITIVE,The sundaes are $15 and also feed 2-3.
5501,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The dessert station was my fave, of course even though by then I was already stuffed so the small parfaits etc were perfect."
5502,FOOD#POSITIVE,5+ stars for the food.
5503,FOOD#POSITIVE,"At least 15 kinds of gelato, cakes, pies, cupcakes, even sugar free cheesecake!"
5504,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Sooo, all weekend my dude has been talking up about this amazing sandwich and so we decided to grab a sandwich before jetting out."
5505,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Don't be fooled, it looks all cute and small in that little paper cone but it seems practically bottomless."
5506,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Great food , great service."
5507,FOOD#POSITIVE,You won't be disappointed with their sandwiches here.
5508,FOOD#POSITIVE,"But for it's location on the strip, being open 24 hours, and the price for a pretty decent sandwich, I'm a fan."
5509,FOOD#POSITIVE,But just having one is enough for two people.
5510,FOOD#POSITIVE,Breakfast dishes are also very good and the coffee is perfect.
5511,FOOD#POSITIVE,Great variety and options for all ages.
5512,FOOD#POSITIVE,"The only bad thing I have to say about Wicked Spoon is that I did not take the time time to try it earlier - what was I thinking  - 
The food was was  excellent 
Service was amazing 
Never thought a buffet could match the service and food quality  of a upscale restaurant - Wicked Spoon has surpassed that expectation 
We will be back again and again"
5513,FOOD#POSITIVE,I cannot begin to explain my love for Bacchanal's dessert area.
5514,FOOD#POSITIVE,The potato cakes with pepperjack were little squares of heaven and I could have made a meal out of them if I wasn't too busy stuffing my face with pain au chocolate.
5515,FOOD#POSITIVE,My only issue is it could have been warmer.
5516,PRICE#POSITIVE,The hubster enjoyed his sandwich and I thought it was a good price for how big it was.
5517,PRICE#POSITIVE,Almost everything that I ate was delicious (and I tried everything).
5518,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Reasonably priced for the strip, and very good burgers."
5519,PRICE#POSITIVE,"The price was higher than I expected but everything in Vegas is a little more than you'd expect, and with that said I definitely feel like I got my money's worth."
5520,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Service was quick, the price was A-OK, and you get a pretty darn good sandwich out of it all, so I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas!"
5521,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Came here a few months ago and while the food was ok, our initial encounter with the cashier wasn't a good one as she accused us of cutting in line when we just tried to walk around a crowd who was trying to figure out payment...fast forward a few months later...we had 2 comps for the buffet...spoke to the manager who verified the comps...he was quite a character..too many red bulls or not enough meds who knows but he reminded me of a disney character, he was also very polite and welcoming."
5522,PRICE#POSITIVE,Earl of Sandwich has really good sandwiches at very affordable prices and IT'S OPEN 24 HOURS!!
5523,PRICE#POSITIVE,A lot of food for the money!
5524,PRICE#POSITIVE,"I always wanted to taste one of his burgers and it tastes really good, not overly pricey for the location, quality and ambience."
5525,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Décor was nice and unique, not plain and boring like other buffets yes its more expensive than other buffets, but its well worth it!!!"
5526,PRICE#POSITIVE,"There are three price options for brunch - brunch with unlimited beverages including coffee, juice and soda ($36), brunch with bottomless mimosas ($51) and carry out ($20)

This place is great for everyone."
5527,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Although the food wasn't great, I'd visit here again; it's an economical place to eat, especially in Vegas."
5528,PRICE#POSITIVE,"If it weren't for the buy-one-get-one free deal we got from the MyVegas game (normally $24 a person, but we got 2 for $24), I would be even more disappointed."
5529,PRICE#POSITIVE,"For the food you get, the price is great!"
5530,PRICE#POSITIVE,The food is real good and fairly reasonable priced for a LV restaurant.
5531,PRICE#POSITIVE,"For ~$70\/couple, I wold say that the food and service was definitely worth it."
5532,PRICE#POSITIVE,"I wanted a smile, a welcome, something kind lol 

Price: Honestly, I expected to pay more."
5533,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Very reasonably priced for Vegas and the portions are rather large, someone told me to split the portions, but my lady and I are tough, we can handle it!"
5534,PRICE#POSITIVE,So my take is:  If you're vegetarian or lactose intolerant... or both... then this is not a great buffet for the price.
5535,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Overall, their price wasn't that bad especially since they're on the strip and I was surprised they weren't charging more for their food, especially for the prime location."
5536,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Food was great especially the chicken sliders...the price point as well as the service was perfect, strongly recommended"
5537,PRICE#POSITIVE,The place is under construction and it was cold outside so seating was hard but my Diamond Total Rewards card helped faster than usual seating and discount pricing.
5538,PRICE#POSITIVE,Sandwiches were huge and worth the dollars.
5539,PRICE#POSITIVE,Good choice of sandwiches and salads for a decent price.
5540,PRICE#POSITIVE,"I definitely would recommend checking this place out, the burgers are delicious and the prices aren't outrageous :) however, the wait time during prime dinner hour is probably really long."
5541,PRICE#POSITIVE,"The brunch was $22 per person, which was WAY less than I've paid at other buffets in Vegas!"
5542,PRICE#POSITIVE,"While I will, because I ended up getting another free buffet meal courtesy of my Red Card."
5543,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Price was right, service exceptional and the food tasted fantastic"
5544,PRICE#POSITIVE,":)

This is our favorite restaurant on the strip due to its ambiance, affordable prices and location."
5545,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Paris, is superior food for about 30% less money."
5546,PRICE#POSITIVE,My sister and I had headed over to Planet Hollywood to try Earl of Sandwich on Saturday afternoon as we wanted something close by and not terribly expensive.
5547,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Tonnes of healthy options, $25 at lunch."
5548,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Mon Ami Gabi is a rare value driven, ""on the strip"" restaraunt."
5549,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Fast, inexpensive and good taste, that's pretty rare for las vegas good."
5550,PRICE#POSITIVE,"The food, service, and atmosphere were great and the prices were very reasonable for a restaurant right on the strip."
5551,PRICE#POSITIVE,You get what you pay for which is a lot of food!
5552,PRICE#POSITIVE,"There drinks and service are real good too, but what do you expect if you pay around $50 for brunch."
5553,PRICE#POSITIVE,"The food is great , large portions at reasonable prices."
5554,PRICE#POSITIVE,Great Thai food at a great price - I love to bring friends here.
5555,PRICE#POSITIVE,$14.95 for a gigantic burger and fries in LV is very affordable!
5556,PRICE#POSITIVE,"It's your basic in casino restaurant, a cheapish place to grab a bit after you just lost your mortgage payment I guess."
5557,PRICE#POSITIVE,"The service is very good, and it's not as expensive as a lot of other places further up the Strip in the Venetian or Palazzo."
5558,PRICE#POSITIVE,"A dinner on a normal night is around $35, which is how much you would pay for a couple legs of Alaskan king crab somewhere else."
5559,PRICE#POSITIVE,Thats a fail...but for the price and quality of all the other wonderful dishes more than made up for it!
5560,PRICE#POSITIVE,We both love Bloody Mary's and we were thrilled with the top shelf Bloody Mary bar for only $12 (a STEAL in Vegas).
5561,PRICE#POSITIVE,"I recently came here during 4th of July weekend and their brunch was only $35.00 where places like the Wynn and Paris were charging $60.00 for holiday brunch (OUTRAGEOUS, and no your $60.00 does not include alcohol)."
5562,PRICE#POSITIVE,"On Friday and Saturday dinner is the gourmet buffet, which we had and you definitely get your money's worth."
5563,PRICE#POSITIVE,This is a good value on the strip.
5564,PRICE#POSITIVE,"I think that was $3.50 but still, it was all well worth it."
5565,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Yes it's the ""best"" value for a buffet (eating all the meats and seafood lol), but the crab was salty."
5566,PRICE#POSITIVE,You pay for what you get for here (~$40 for a tasty buffet that's not bad).
5567,PRICE#POSITIVE,"The food was amazing, and very reasonably priced."
5568,PRICE#POSITIVE,"I know everyone complains about the buffet prices but if you come at this time, you will be greeted with 1) no line and 2) the option to pay for lunch price."
5569,PRICE#POSITIVE,I could not finish the salad because the portion was huge which is why I think the 17 dollar price tag was fair and the tuna was so good!
5570,PRICE#POSITIVE,"i'm not a sandwich person, but a must-visit for a cheap quality meal after lady luck takes a dump on your chest."
5571,PRICE#POSITIVE,Prices were fair especially being in Las Vegas.
5572,PRICE#POSITIVE,worth every penny spent always recommending and i have eaten here plenty of times
5573,PRICE#POSITIVE,Came here for dinner during my last Vegas trip and of all the buffets on the strip this is probably the best bang for your buck.
5574,PRICE#POSITIVE,We went twice because it was a cheap option downstairs at Planet Hollywood.
5575,PRICE#POSITIVE,The price was not bad at all for Vegas at $19.95 per person.
5576,PRICE#POSITIVE,"For under $15 (including a bag of baked chips) for all the food ordered, you really can't go wrong with Earl.... especially since it's open 24 hours."
5577,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Just a tasty sandwich on delicious bread for a great price, especially as we were on the strip."
5578,PRICE#POSITIVE,The food was not expensive either compared to other casino restaurants.
5579,PRICE#POSITIVE,"They have an unlimited wine special for about $8 a glass, and the house wine is pretty good."
5580,PRICE#POSITIVE,"They have some pretty solid dishes, price wasn't too bad $40 but let me say one thing KOBE BEEF \/ Crab legs were amazing, sushi selection kind of sucked, and the desert\/fruits were nice and fresh, with that being said well worth the 40 dollars spent."
5581,PRICE#POSITIVE,Worth it if you have never been and are ok with the price.
5582,PRICE#POSITIVE,"(BurGR)

Anyway, service was 5-star quality, atmosphere was really nice, and the food was totally worth the price, which ended up being like $25 for sharing three sides + burger with four people."
5583,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Through the drunk days and nights if you want a delicious sandwich at a affordable price, go to Earls :D"
5584,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Prices are good, line isnt really that bad and its a good sandwich!"
5585,PRICE#POSITIVE,Probably best bang for the buck out in Vegas.
5586,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Admittedly the sandwiches themselves were nothing spectacular on the palate, but Earl of Sandwich wins four out of five purely on the value that you are getting from the quality of these six dollar sandwiches worthy of Vegas's demanding taste buds."
5587,PRICE#POSITIVE,"The food alone makes the price worthwhile, but it's even more reasonable when compared to the other buffets on the strip."
5588,PRICE#POSITIVE,What a bargain for Las Vegas!
5589,PRICE#POSITIVE,"If you're looking for a quality cheap sandwich in Vegas, Earl of Sandwich is a great choice."

only good thing about this buffet is that its $22 and comes with one free mamosa or champage, or bloody marie, if you're into that

presentation was very nice and creative, but it was very depressing to finally bite into the food and realize it didn't taste good."
5669,PRICE#POSITIVE,"This place has one of the best steaks in Las Vegas for the price, whenever I have someone visiting from out of town this is on my list of places I have to take them, the view on the patio is absolutely breathtaking and you'll catch the Bellagio fountains at least a couple times during your dinner which is fantastic if you aren't used to them, but the best part about this place is definitely the steak I highly recommend the peppercorn one I order it every time and it is absolutely amazing!"
5670,PRICE#POSITIVE,Non alcoholic drinks are free of charge and they change up the food from time to time.

5679,PRICE#POSITIVE,Reasonably priced for the portion size.
5680,PRICE#POSITIVE,A note to all everything is ala carte which means Burger don't come with fries and you pay for what you get it's a upscale restaurant but worth trying.

5682,PRICE#POSITIVE,Omggggg it's just as good as the Caesars palace buffet but cheaper.
5683,PRICE#POSITIVE,"In term of price, I think they are very reasonable for the quality of food you get here."

5693,PRICE#POSITIVE,These both provide better food for your buck.

5695,PRICE#POSITIVE,It was one of the cheapest meals of the trip and it was by far the most delicious.

5712,PRICE#POSITIVE,"You may be spending a little bit extra on a dessert, but you get what you pay for."
5713,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Sandwiches are tops and at $6-7 a pop, it's very reasonable."

5722,PRICE#POSITIVE,"In Vegas, I know I'm gonna spend  and lose a lot of money because i'm a terrible gambler since slot machines are so hypnotizing and i'm the unluckiest person you would ever meet, so this sandwich helped me stay fed in Vegas - its very affordable, especially by Las Vegas standards."

5726,PRICE#POSITIVE,"This buffet was a bit high priced, I mainly went for the seafood offering and the only crab legs I saw being served (hot and cold) were snow crab... at the price they were charging was hoping for a much better selection.. pretty much became an ordinary buffet, though I did get my fill of crab legs."
5727,PRICE#POSITIVE,Nothing bad to say about this place if you want great food at a great price this little hidden gem in Vegas is worth the drive.
5728,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Eggs done just the way I liked them, awesome bacon and sausages, ham on the bone, granola, fruit smoothie, two types of smoked salmon - yeah I really pigged out but at $17 for breakfast you have to!"

5732,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Good news is no waiting line and price is cheaper, bad news is that the choices of the food is quite limited."
5733,PRICE#POSITIVE,"As some of the reviews state, yes there is definitely a wait, and yes, the cashiers are definitely not the most pleasant people... but overall, I thought this buffet was well worth the $40."

5798,PRICE#POSITIVE,"The Buffet at the Wynn is different, because for $20 in Vegas, one salad pretty much makes the whole thing worth while."
5799,PRICE#POSITIVE,"I thought it was going to cost more, but it was just enough for everything we ordered."
5800,PRICE#POSITIVE,My friend had a players card that had $300 comp for food and drinks so we came here for dinner for that reason.

5824,PRICE#POSITIVE,"I'm a fan of a value proposition, and this is a great one."
5825,PRICE#POSITIVE,"I've been to many of the buffets in Atlantic City, NJ's casinos (ie: Borgata) and for a similar price the Bellagio definitely trumps all of those."
5826,PRICE#POSITIVE,"1) Great service
2) Good and consistent food quality
3) Ambiance is great but keep in mind it is a cafe setting so it is a bit noisy
4) Reasonable pricing for Vegas center strip location
5) Beverage cost not blow up."
5827,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Great food, awesome wine list, high quality stems, friendly service and reasonable prices."

5839,PRICE#POSITIVE,This was the best buffet I've had in Vegas for the price.
5840,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Excellent service, reasonable Vegas prices for food that does not include french fries or gas bubbles and a great decor."
5841,PRICE#POSITIVE,The best part about all this is I honestly felt that they could have charged more yet they kept it at a relatively low price for a hotel of its stature.
5842,PRICE#POSITIVE,"The room is beautiful as well, and the $50\/pp cost seemed reasonable to us, considering the variety - you could have a 4-course meal, and the desserts were out of this world -- again, small and manageable to try a bunch."
5843,PRICE#POSITIVE,Lots of variety of food and everything I tried was very tasteful... but they didn't have too Many desserts..price is pretty decent...

5846,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Every once in a while, on family road trips, we'd stop in to Vegas or Reno for the $5 buffets."
5847,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Wicked Spoon does have several appeals though--sexy ambiance, free flowing water, and tapa-style individual portions."
5848,PRICE#POSITIVE,"For the quality of the food, and the overall atmosphere compared to other restaurants, the price was right!"
5849,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Other than that, the view of the Bellagio fountains and your not-so-crazy prices, make you worth eating here."
5850,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Since most restaurants on the strip are ridiculously expensive this one was surprisingly affordable, especially if you go there for lunch."
5851,PRICE#POSITIVE,Who would have thought you could buy a very good $7 meal on the strip in Vegas?
5852,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Perks:  reasonably priced, outdoor seating, and no need for reservations for brunch"

5854,PRICE#POSITIVE,TIP:  show them your total rewards card so you can get the food $1 cheaper.
5855,PRICE#POSITIVE,The huge portions coupled with tasty food and reasonable pricing definitely sets this place apart.

What I liked about Wicked: It's cheap!"
5866,PRICE#POSITIVE,All really good - especially for the price.
5867,PRICE#POSITIVE,Since we got a good deal we didn't feel as pressured to only eat the expensive stuff and we discovered the congee was amazing.
5868,PRICE#POSITIVE,"I'd certainly eat here again if in the area--it's a good value for the money, and tasty :)"
5869,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Well worth the money any day of the week, I highly recommend the Wicked Spoon!"
5870,PRICE#POSITIVE,"For about $40, you are treated to a truly extensive variety of food."

5873,PRICE#POSITIVE,Moderately priced but with moderate food quality.

High standards and great value"

5879,PRICE#POSITIVE,Solid tasty sandwiches at good prices.
5880,PRICE#POSITIVE,"At the end if you're looking for a sandwich and salad meal for under $13 US, definitely go to Earl."
5881,PRICE#POSITIVE,"$22 for lunch, $29 for dinner so its one of the better bargains for buffets when considering the decent quality."
5882,PRICE#POSITIVE,It's kinda pricy but it's all worth it.
5883,PRICE#POSITIVE,"And although it may seem pricey, for Vegas (and for the quality) it's actually a great deal."
5884,PRICE#POSITIVE,"The view of the fountains is delightful, the food is good, and the price was not too overpriced given the location."
5885,PRICE#POSITIVE,The Italian sandwich was great and for $2 extra meat I wasn't upset with the price of it being about $8 or $9.

The price is 25% less than the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars."
5887,PRICE#POSITIVE,Good variety great price and cool ambiance.
5888,PRICE#POSITIVE,"And even though I am not typically a dessert or sweets person, I could not resist the decadent array of mini desserts...the creme brûlée melted in my mouth along with a vegan passion fruit mousse and a raspberry chocolate confection...mmmm...at $25.99 for lunch, you can't beat the value and experience...."
5889,PRICE#POSITIVE,prices are very decent for the portion sizes!

5896,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Pricey, but you get what you paid for!"
5897,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Great place for sandwiches on the strip, affordable too for Vegas!"
5898,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Mah Fat Phucklets know yer boy ain't one to complain about the price of a meal, but I ain't stupid enough to pass up a good deal when I see it."
5899,PRICE#POSITIVE,So another person had written a review about how this buffet has a good weekday brunch price ($27) on the same day I went to go try it (12\/19\/16).
5900,PRICE#POSITIVE,"However, it is an overall solid restaurant on the Vegas strip that will get you good food for a relatively good price with a great view."

5907,PRICE#POSITIVE,"The selection isn't as vast as Wynn, but considering the cheaper price, I guess that's acceptable."
5908,PRICE#POSITIVE,"And considering the prices of a lot of other places within Planet Hollywood\/Miracle Mile and the rest of the Strip, the prices aren't bad."
5909,PRICE#POSITIVE,"I will definitely be back, hopefully the wait times remain short and they don't raise their prices."
5910,PRICE#POSITIVE,"One of my favorite buffets in Vegas....awesome goodness

This place, in my opinon, is BETTER than the Wynn buffet because not only does it offer a wider selection of food, it is also a few bucks cheaper than the Wynn."
5911,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Yes, it could possibly be the most expensive, but the quality of food and environment of the place is fantastic."
5912,PRICE#POSITIVE,"If you are around the area and want a quick, cheap bit, there's not many other better choices."

5918,PRICE#POSITIVE,"A bit on the pricier side as we went during the gourmet buffet but with your choices of rack of lamb, king crab, steak tartar and other premium food choices (plus being on the strip) the price is reasonable."
5919,PRICE#POSITIVE,Cheap.
5920,PRICE#POSITIVE,I think it's definitely worth it though if you're hungry and looking for a cheap choice.
5921,PRICE#POSITIVE,"I thought a few things on the buffet were very good like the smoked salmon, the beet, fancy cheese and hazelnut vinaigrette salad and the mini lime cream puff."
5922,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Technically if you pay $40 for brunch and have about 8-9 mimosas, they're only $4-$5 each, in addition to the food!"
5923,PRICE#POSITIVE,Solid food and a great value considering the location and view.
5924,PRICE#POSITIVE,One sandwich averages about $5!
5925,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Earl of Sandwich is very reminiscent of a Panera Bread style lunch bistro, with amazing prices for the strip."
5926,PRICE#POSITIVE,The buffet is a great way to fill up without breaking your bank at other more expensive establishments.
5927,PRICE#POSITIVE,Pretty good pricing and meal timing for Vegas.
5928,PRICE#POSITIVE,Prices are what you expect from the area.

5935,PRICE#POSITIVE,"The amount of food they give you is like ""hungry man"" portions, and value, is well worth every penny!"
5936,PRICE#POSITIVE,The food was great and cheap and the restaurant has a cool vibe.
5937,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Even if you only take one trip through for surf and turf with sides, that's your money's worth right there."
5938,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Momentarily shocked Easter weekend brunch was ~$50+ but it was worth it, $1 discount with players card."
5939,PRICE#POSITIVE,It is $50 for dinner but this is Vegas and that is not a bad deal.
5940,PRICE#POSITIVE,Atmosphere was comforting and prices were affordable.
5941,PRICE#POSITIVE,I had never experienced a Gordon Ramsay restaurant before this past weekend and I wanted to do it without spending a ton of $$.
5942,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Meat, carbs, salad, dessert... Worth your buck."
5943,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Back home, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant but in Vegas it is the Americana version of classic French Bistro without breaking the bank."
5944,PRICE#POSITIVE,Portions are huge and the prices are so reasonable for a restaurant in a Casino!
5945,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Even better is that they have $9 bottom less mimosas that also includes bloody Marys, wine, or champagne."
5946,PRICE#POSITIVE,"For me, it was good enough and I'd honestly come back here again to fit the bill of a casual dining place that doesn't break the bank, which has nice views of the beautiful Bellagio fountains."
5947,PRICE#POSITIVE,"We were seating at the bar and wereoffered the specials, $13 gets you all you can drink mimosa, champagne, Bloody Mary, and beer."
5948,PRICE#POSITIVE,It is more affordable of Gordons restaurants.
5949,PRICE#POSITIVE,Unlimited mimosas and champagne with your brunch for $12.
5950,PRICE#POSITIVE,"At the end of the day this place delivers what i expect from a ~35 dollar buffet in Vegas

Some type of crab legs, a carving station with prime rib, a decent selection of fish\/seafood dishes, and sushi that doesn't suck too bad"
5951,PRICE#POSITIVE,Waited an hour at least and paid $57 for dinner but well worth it.
5952,PRICE#POSITIVE,$6 for a sandwich isn't bad at all.
5953,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Great food, decent prices considering it's Vegas and also it's Gordon Ramsay."
5954,PRICE#POSITIVE,$45 is nuttin for the quality you get at Wynn.
5955,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Price: you get what you pay for - order a few items, but bring a crowd, you'll need the back-up 
Atmosphere: whimsical and fun
Overall: Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll stop in the first night of the weekend, that way I'll have three days to finish the cake!"
5956,PRICE#POSITIVE,"$15 for unlimited sparkling wine\/ champagne and other stuff

For the price you want to see quality food, and it really was."
5957,PRICE#POSITIVE,They'd give subway a run for their money.
5958,PRICE#POSITIVE,"However I rate it with a 4 star because the all you can drink champagne for 7$ , the organization and all the type of food we were able to try makes it worth visiting at the Ceaser Palace hotel in las vegas"
5959,PRICE#POSITIVE,Worth the price!!!
5960,PRICE#POSITIVE,"There are so many options to choose from, &at the same time you're paying for the experience."
5961,PRICE#POSITIVE,"I actually thought this place was okay & a bit pricey, but then I went to Rio world buffet and then I realized, Wynn buffet is sooo worth the money!"
5962,PRICE#POSITIVE,"The main things that stick out is that the fresh bread is good, it is very good value, and it's fast."
5963,PRICE#POSITIVE,"The buffet itself is not to bad pp either, considering what you're getting."
5964,PRICE#POSITIVE,"prices are super reasonable (about $6 per sandwich), and the selection is huge!"
5965,PRICE#POSITIVE,Prices were reasonable compared to most places around.
5966,PRICE#POSITIVE,This place is thee best place to get large portions with little price to pay.
5967,PRICE#POSITIVE,Really delicious French bistro food at a great price.
5968,PRICE#POSITIVE,Not a bad brunch for $35... but once is probably enough.
5969,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Moderately priced for Vegas
Good service 
Not too long of a wait time on a Friday night"
5970,PRICE#POSITIVE,"The price is very reasonable for the exquisite
Food and the spectacular view of the strip at night."
5971,PRICE#POSITIVE,"With some really fabulous buffets, it's almost unfair to compare a restaurant based on just one dish-- but this place has good food without gouging you price wise."
5972,PRICE#POSITIVE,I would venture that it's the only place on the strip where you can have such a great view and good food at such a reasonable price.
5973,PRICE#POSITIVE,"For two of us, our bill came to $29."
5974,PRICE#POSITIVE,"the crab and prime rib), but if you're on a budget, definitely check out the lunch... it'll likely be better than any other buffet... even their dinner ones!"
5975,PRICE#POSITIVE,I think dessert is a ridiculous value given Vegas food prices!
5976,PRICE#POSITIVE,Cheap sandwiches offered 24 hours!
5977,PRICE#POSITIVE,Price is perfect.
5978,PRICE#POSITIVE,The sundaes are $15 and also feed 2-3.

5980,PRICE#POSITIVE,"The other entries were above your average buffet, which was nice, and which was expected at the price and location."
5981,PRICE#POSITIVE,A bit steep for a buffet but definitely worth it!
5982,PRICE#POSITIVE,Served in mini dishes and totally worth the $$!
5983,PRICE#POSITIVE,Probably less expensive than the average nice steakhouse on the strip.
5984,PRICE#POSITIVE,You can save yourself $1 by signing up for Total Rewards however.
5985,PRICE#POSITIVE,Overall very excellent and a decent value for the quality at $23USD.
5986,PRICE#POSITIVE,"The prices here for brunch is $24 +tax and dinner price is $38+ tax, which is pretty average in Vegas."
5987,PRICE#POSITIVE,"But what I do remember and know is that our waitress was the bomb, the food was well worth the price of admission and I can't wait to get back to the Hash House."
5988,PRICE#POSITIVE,"But for it's location on the strip, being open 24 hours, and the price for a pretty decent sandwich, I'm a fan."
5989,PRICE#POSITIVE,We went in at 2:15pm when they still charge you their lunch price ($38\/person).
5990,PRICE#POSITIVE,"We had a $25 dining credit, so we decided to use the credit at the Bacchanal Buffet, based on the reviews we saw."
5991,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Good quick food, and helpfully cheaper than a lot of the other options around."
5992,PRICE#POSITIVE,"For $37 you get free-flowing mimosas, bloody marys, or champagne."
5993,PRICE#POSITIVE,I am currently trying to lose some weight for my wedding but I'm not crazy enough to pass up an offer like that.
5994,PRICE#POSITIVE,"Why pay such high prices for other fancy places when this place is affordable, brand name, and all around delicious?"
5995,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Food was desiccated from staying under warmers too long, mediocre flavors, fewer special dishes..."
5996,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I was so hungry so to make it taste better i drowned the burger in tabasco, which was a pretty bad idea."
5997,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I felt the selection was lacking, service was slow, and the price just really didn't match up with the amount of sub-par food I was able to consume."
5998,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Which is even more of a reason it was so disappointing to receive the horrible quality of food and service the second time.
5999,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"For example, macaron's quality\/texture was what made it bad."
6000,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,It ruined my crab buffet dinner plan.
6001,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The beshamel sauce was grainy meaning under cook, and unappealing and a sad pile of pomme frites on the side."
6002,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Everything else was just plain jane to my eyes and my stomach.
6003,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,In short: quality of the buffet is questionable.
6004,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,It was pretty good for a sandwich but still don't get why they have such rave reviews.
6005,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Their whiskey cherry cocktail is too sweet for my taste and gave me a wicked headache.
6006,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"go to the Spice Market at Ph, save money and get great food."
6007,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The Chinese dishes were among the most uninspired, ordinary food ever to grace a pair of chopsticks."
6008,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,There was nothing in the asian section that I thought was worth eating at all.
6009,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I feel Subway tastes better and is also cheaper.
6010,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Although the food wasn't great, I'd visit here again; it's an economical place to eat, especially in Vegas."
6011,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I don't mind the prices of the buffet to rise, just didn't expect the quality of the food to drop at the same time."
6012,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"If it were a little less expensive, or if the food was extraordinary, it would've been a five star review, but I didn't try anything that would warrant a 60 dollar price tag."
6013,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"They are not curries, as they are just your selection of protein (chicken, or shrimp, or beef, etc.)"
6014,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Too many choices in Vegas to eat here, find some good quality food!"
6015,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The tomato sauce is an odd flavor to blend with breakfast foods.
6016,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"More on the ""meh"" side:
-Roast Beef was dry
- Regular sushi rolls are just decent, seaweed salad is salty
-Desserts are average - there is nothing spectacular about them (although most of them are pretty)
-Service, as far as beverages and such, might take a while during busy hours

One last note: GO EARLY."
6017,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"However, these burgers were just a really greasy version of Umami burgers.. except they're in vegas."
6018,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,A classic example of food looking better than it tastes.
6019,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I don't like wasting food, but I also refuse to fill up on things that aren't good after dropping $40 to eat there."
6020,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"During my experiences, I had to admit I was a bit disappointed at the service and the food."
6021,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Prime rib was tough, crab leg was salty, terrible service."
6022,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The desserts were a disappointment as I know it is one of their strengths yet the chef was not able to tell me which ones contained nuts since my wife is deathly allergic.
6023,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The made to order foods were mostly not great.
6024,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I took a bite and could not swallow it.
6025,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,My husband tried the chicken and brie sandwich and neither of us really liked it that much.
6026,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The service was decent and the food is ok, although not amazing."
6027,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Poor quality food, mediocre selection."
6028,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Got 5 different drinks and they are all gross.
6029,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,feel like quality has declined... their menu has changed no more meatball =( but still a good option for late night eats still 24\/7
6030,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Crab legs were not very tasty but I had to have them anyway since it seemed to be the only way to justify the steep price tag for the meal.
6031,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The pork was bland and the potatoes were burnt.
6032,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Everything was really bland.
6033,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"It is a large buffet so the star, but the food is not fresh, the price ridiculously expensive, the horrible service the waitress spoke all the time doing nothing with the ones at the next table and without filling the glasses."
6034,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Don't get me wrong now, I'm not saying the food was not edible."
6035,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The Asian dishes were underwhelming.
6036,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Even texas road house steak tasted better.
6037,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Maybe I was expecting a lot more but this place is overpriced and the food is just blah.
6038,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Meat - the prime rib here looks good visually but it is flavorless with no beefy flavor and juices that taste like nothing.
6039,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Skip the sushi section unless you are from an area that doesn't have decent sushi (must be sad).
6040,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I felt like I paid more for presentation than taste.
6041,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Some of the things I ate weren't worth the tummy space - the pad thai was no good.
6042,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Sushi: disappointing as well, there were only a few rolls and none of them were something you couldn't get at a grocery store."
6043,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The sushi station is pathetic; I tried the salmon sushi & could hardly taste any salmon.
6044,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,My dad fell asleep at the tail end of our meal.
6045,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Nothing special ... Food not hot service not good at all there are baby better buffet
6046,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I say it's better to go to one of the cheaper buffets in Vegas or Bacchanal because the food is way better there and at least you get more out of what you pay for.
6047,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"So, I just paid $300 (family of 5) for the worst and most disgusting buffet in my life."
6048,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"mexican kitchen didn't do anything for me so i skipped that as well as the salad and asian kitchen, maybe only trying the roast duck and i got grossed out since it was too lumpy and the day that i went, such area of the buffet really didnt sold out as the rest."
6049,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Food was displayed so beautifully, but some of the dishes weren't that good."
6050,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Tasted like heavy, chain restaurant food that doesn't have a balance."
6051,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The chinese food reminded me of a typical Chinese buffet, the sushi was sloppily made and rice was just bad, the miso marinated sea bass was way overcooked and had a weird texture because of it, the ""prime rib"" was tough and dry, the lamb chop was overcooked,  the crab legs were still partially frozen, and the oysters made me wonder if I was going to be spending time with the porcelain goddess later that night."
6052,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The Bad -  tasteless chewy sashimi, no macarons (boooooo), 
Most of the other stuff were so so."
6053,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"This place definitely has the selection but like all buffets, the food is dry and old."
6054,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The Japanese station, i tried one of the shrimp takoyaki (no tako just shrimp) and it was just mushy inside so i just passed on everything else, the sushi didn't look too fresh either."
6055,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Even a great restaurant can sometimes serve a bad meal, a steak too tough, or a dish just not prepared the way it should have been."
6056,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Yes, the decor was gorgeous, but there was really nothing about this buffet that made it stand out from other average buffets on the strip that I've been to."
6057,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Cold and not fresh food get low mark on my reviews.
6058,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,It was made with butter lettuce instead of Romaine and I missed the crunch.
6059,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"After having the variations prepared by Brian, Nicole, and Gregg at my Bloody Mary Battle, this seemed outright amateurish."
6060,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,But none of the desserts were worth finishing  (the carrot\/pineapple cake was actually spit out worthy. )
6061,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,First of all my burger was pretty dry and the vegetables looked like it was pre packed the night before under a blow dryer.
6062,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,you are spending 56$ for food that are worse than fastfood.
6063,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"However, the fish dishes were a bit disappointing."
6064,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,a lot of other food was either too salty or just plain bland.
6065,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I went for breakfast, and there was no king crab in sight- just Jonah crab, which is second-tier in comparison, and difficult to eat."
6066,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"If you like good bread and tiny portions of tasteless meat and cheese, then this is the place."
6067,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Suffice it to say that this is a dessert that is a lot of money for a lot of nothing.
6068,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"You expected this girl to think your burgers were off the hook and make you my number one burger place in Vegas with this week old meat,  Skimpy toppings and awful service."
6069,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Milkshakes are 1\/2 shake, 1\/2 pudding and we found the pudding to be grainy."
6070,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I thought though it had a bit too much of a sweet taste for my liking.
6071,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Not necessarily the best kind of french cuisine I would have hoped.
6072,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,were all underseasoned.
6073,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Yes this is an all you can eat but if the food don't taste good what are you gonna eat?
6074,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Skip this place and go to a super market and buy some milk and choco powder.
6075,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The food was either too bland or too salty in my opinion.
6076,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES - Hand cut fries, truffle Parmesan, truffle salt, truffle aioli

These hand-cut fries tasted almost identical to the kind you can get in the frozen section of the grocery store."
6077,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,A scallop dish was okay but slightly bland.
6078,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Paying like 80 dollas for dinner I expected wayyyyyy better quality food.
6079,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,50 minutes to get a grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup that tastes subpar.
6080,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Cold food, classic day-old looking fried chicken, mashed potatoes with the ubiquitous protective dried shell, and the gravy that looks frozen-over."
6081,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Seafood selection was pathetic, probably only a handful to choose from: shrimp cocktail (nothing exciting), scallops (dry due to sitting under the food heat lamp), couple of seafood sushi, and Chinese pan fried shrimps (didn't even try because their batter looked thick and oily)."
6082,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"This was once my favorite all you can eat spot in Vegas - but like all of the other places, the quality of the food deteriorates as it gets more popular."
6083,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,2 out of the 3 dishes were just totally wrong.
6084,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The oysters are not the freshest and one left a weird after taste.
6085,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"--they didn't have prime rib, or any high quality (beef) steaks for that matter."
6086,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Avoid the variety of fishes near the Chinese food though, because these are usually dry."
6087,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The lunch buffet is definatly worth going to...the food is fresh and cooked with care.
6088,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Yes it's the ""best"" value for a buffet (eating all the meats and seafood lol), but the crab was salty."
6089,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Food looks really pretty but it tastes terrible.
6090,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Left a star off for coffee that was just ok and heavy\/dry biscuit.
6091,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The famous bone marrow was not fresh or taste at all and snow crab was worst ever it seems like you could see in cheap Chinese buffet in town - all meat apart itself, dry, and small."
6092,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Overall, I think the quality of the food is great!"
6093,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I was so full of mediocre food, I had little room for dessert."
6094,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Huge disappointment on the food quality.
6095,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Their Italian food was horrible without the authenticity of a fresh pasta dish.
6096,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Sushi was not very good and cheese were just ordinary store bought grades.
6097,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Crab legs looked & tasted like leftover scraps from another buffet.
6098,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The Asian food section did not look appetizing at all.
6099,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The service is slow an the food is awful this was my third visit and every time the service and food kept getting worse!
6100,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I have to say the portions are HUGE but the meal is overall bland for my taste and always arriving luke warm\/room temp.
6101,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"My boyfriend excitedly filled his plate with the selections from the meat-carving station only to find out that most of the lamb chop had been fat and it was underwhelming, despite the grand presentation."
6102,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"However, it seems like the quality of the food has gone down a bit."
6103,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"a brunch should have other lunch meats roast beef, ham and turkey and they had churros which is a type of sugar donut which looked good until you bite into it."
6104,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The fish was dry and had no flavor.
6105,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I thought Vegas buffets were good and cheap..boy was I wrong!!!
6106,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The only reason I did not leave a 5 star review was because the fries were a bit dry and lacked some flavor.
6107,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Chefs of wicked spoon, please taste your food before you send it out!"
6108,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"As a big fan of Thai food, I thought I was going to have a great meal, but.........NOT!!!!"
6109,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The presentation deceived me, i ordered the chicken and waffles, waffles had 2 strips on bacon inside which was tasty, but the chicken was just DRY."
6110,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Service was bad, the food quite tasteless but nice decour and location."
6111,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The meat was hard to get out of the shells which is usually a sign that the crab wasn't fresh.
6112,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"This location has only been open for about two months and the kitchen is not as fast as the Sahara location, this is why there are empty tables."
6113,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I had the euro burger and my husband had the chanterelle burger.. ingredients were good, good meat, but somehow was dry and missing cohesion."
6114,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I thought that the concept of this place is awesome; they have a big variety of beer and some very tasty shakes.
6115,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Their salad station was boring.
6116,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,It was not as good as the buffet dinners at the M or the Bellagio.
6117,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Drunken noodles with seafood: 0\/5 again, portion was small for the price."
6118,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The onion rings were decent but the dipping sauces were great!
6119,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,If Your looking for Cheap Not fresh ingredients.
6120,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The Korean short ribs were tough.
6121,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"If you eat a lot of seafood, you will be able to tell instantly the fish is not up to par."
6122,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,My problem lies with the damn salt content and the server being incognito.
6123,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Well, take your average buffet - the food is plentiful, but the taste, quality, and presentation echo that of a prison scene from a movie, or from the hallowed past of your elementary school cafeteria days."
6124,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Use to love this buffet but the last 3 times I came was just poor.
6125,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Absolutely awful experience.
6126,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I got food poisoning here from eating their quiche.
6127,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,All the other food was very bland.
6128,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,They had a great selection of items however not all items were as tasty as they looked.
6129,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The ice cream was crystally like it'd been frozen a very long time, and the cake portion was cloyingly sweet."
6130,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,My son said the salmon is dry and the kids options aren't great either.
6131,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The oyster was small and wasn't much flavor either, lack freshness."
6132,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"the food is no longer as delicious as i remembered, there were fewer options, and seafood did not seem fresh."
6133,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The cakes and other sweets, although appeared enticing, lacked the quality to satisfy our already damaged tastebuds from the salty meats and seafood."
6134,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Dessert was okay due to large selection, but still not as tasty as I had hoped."
6135,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"There were many things that ended up being unique about this restaurant, unfortunately the quality of the food was not one of them."
6136,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Nothing worth talking about with the food, but the beer selection was good."
6137,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I think for $50 per person it didn't wow me as much as I think it should, there is a huge selection of food but nothing stood out."
6138,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The fries looked nice, but they too, were bland."
6139,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The excessive amount of salt totally ruined the dishes.
6140,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"It tasted like chocolate powder, and not in a good way."
6141,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The asian soups are kind of a miss for me.
6142,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"So minus a star for disgusting dry quiche, and another for subpar service."
6143,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Wish the food had better selection & quality.
6144,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"After receiving the correct steak, I found it to be overlooked, cold and overall a low quality cut."
6145,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The food was okay, but not as good as a regular restaurant."
6146,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"This is one of my favorite dishes to make at home too, what a disappointment."
6147,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"It wasn't the line that I was most upset about (I don't mind a long line if my food is good) well with that being said, our pretzel wasn't all that great, it was hard and cold."
6148,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,WRONG I ordered the chicken fried steak and the was more fried batter than steak.
6149,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"My family member threw up, had fever after eating this buffet the day before yesterday."
6150,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Creating so much food in such a quantity simply loses the focus and flavor of these dishes, and although there was nothing so bad, none of the food was good enough to make us say ""wow, we would come back just for this or that""."
6151,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The food in every stations has been sitting there and all dried up.
6152,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I saw some burgers and eggs on the menu, but honestly, you can get that anywhere."
6153,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Other sides for the table were for me generally unremarkable.
6154,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"It was not even a frozen consistency, it was chocolate milk."
6155,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,It was a bland BurGR.
6156,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I was very disappointed and unimpressed with both he presentation and quality.
6157,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I tried a little bit of everything, but the salad bar (waste of stomach space)."
6158,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The food here is watered down sweet interpretation of Thai food.
6159,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I got a prime rib that I wouldn't have eaten at the worst buffet in the world.
6160,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Chang for better quality) and the rest of the buffet is a combination of a hell lot of things that left you no remark in your mind no matter how hard you try to remember.
6161,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"For sides I had the frites (which were sadly not very good) and the Brussel sprouts with bacon- which were good, but a little dry."
6162,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"), and squid ink pasta (which didn't taste like much)."
6163,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Anyway, the food was cooked so long until it was overlooked and dried out such as the dumplings (sprinkled with so much salt I'd swear it was the pork belly), fried chicken, beef at cutting station, horrible jerk chicken, chicken over rice with peanuts.I tried the mushy angry mac & cheese, terrible faux sushi; snatched from me while plating and he thought it was funny but the jokes on you because you have lost my family as customers."
6164,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The food  quality and selection here seems to have down as I was reading my previous review.
6165,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"We paid $102 for a basic dinner for a family of five, and that includes no charge for the raw slider hamburgers, a 20% discount for the rest of the bill, and a 20% tip for the waiter for his terrific service."
6166,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The Hollandaise sauce was bland and the English muffin was soggy.
6167,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The food and service was fantastic, up until an adolescent cockroach zoomed across our table during dessert."
6168,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Even if I did go to the Italian stand and ask for hot crab legs, the meat wasn't as fleshy or as tasty as  I would've expected."
6169,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Horrible food with worst service ever.
6170,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I do love their presentation of the food items, however, I think they should really work on the taste of their food before presentation."
6171,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I was disappointed in the execution but it had good ingredients.
6172,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Too bad, as the rest of the meal was pretty good but no excuse for shoe leather like steaks at a steak house!"
6173,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"However, this buffet is all about looks and not about the food."
6174,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Both salmon and cod were way overcooked and was very bland.
6175,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The sushi was rather disappointing, not enough selection and not tasty."
6176,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"So we decided to finally get hold of this wicked buffet....

Food taste bland."
6177,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I highly doubt that most people can finish their food.
6178,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The buffet has crab legs, but they are snow crab, not king crab, and average quality."
6179,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Interesting tastes that I'm happy I tried, but perhaps wouldn't go for again:
-Blue corn pancake with berry butter topping- healthy, but it got cold fast, even though it is made to order at the pancake station."
6180,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I know it's not easy to keep food under hot lights or over steamers and preserve quality but it's just not good here.
6181,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Food is ok only.
6182,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"They had all the standard breakfast foods, sausages, bacon, eggs, waffles etc, but nothing fancy smancy."
6183,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"However, it turns out to be the worst buffet I have ever tried at Vegas."
6184,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,It was a complete disappointment first of all we pay $7 to park to go eat at this place.
6185,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Also, don't order tea in Vegas and think it's gonna be sweet like we do in the south."
6186,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Second one-the food was absolutely not good at all, not even one dish was good... Maybe just chicken noodle soup..."
6187,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Crazy expensive buffet, very little was decent-tasting."
6188,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Take a walk around the hotel but skip the buffet and go to the one at ballagio for 10 bucks cheaper and food that won't make you sick.
6189,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,And the skate could've been seasoned just a touch more.
6190,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"For this I could have went to another restaurant on the strip and had ONE quality dish, rather than a taste of several ok ones."
6191,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I think I ate all my custard cause it tasted like leche flan (shout out to all my Filipinos), sampled the rest of the desserts and pushed them to the side of my plate."
6192,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The rest of the food was ok, but the worst was probably the sushi - rice was not cooked properly."
6193,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,My chicken was a tad overcooked so it was a bit like jerky on parts of it.
6194,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"We found them to be a bit bland, a bit lacking in selection, basically just not as good as the Caesars's buffet, but a close second."
6195,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Throughout the meal, the food was at most mediocre and most likely able to be bought at any restaurant in our home town, making us instantly regret our decision to spend more than $200 on the place."
6196,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Dessert bar was not good with the exception of blueberry cheesecake.
6197,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Too heavy on the stomach.
6198,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Our food was also somehow not quite as good.
6199,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Although portions were a lot, taste of food was not worth it."
6200,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The Golden Tofu was generic, tasteless, watery fried tofu that I could have had done better, at any other Thai place, for $4."
6201,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"We also ordered the truffle fries, which we couldn't even really taste the truffle oil, and they were soggy."
6202,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,$46.50 total bill.... excited to see it arrive disappointed by the lack of flavor.
6203,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,And I was surprised about how bland both of our Burgers were.
6204,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Food - tried the crab legs - was way over salty even without the butter.
6205,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I know they are famous of the chicken and waffles but I did not get that because it does not seem appetizing to me.
6206,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"However, the Asian selection was disappointing with the only sushi being fairly pedestrian rolls and the dim sum of the day being an unidentifiable overly-cooked dark greyish-yellow lump."
6207,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I don't like huge portions and sugar saturated foods.
6208,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The mint chocolate mousse was really interesting - it made me want to put down my toothbrush, spit out the contents of my mouth, and gargle some water."
6209,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Each year, the quality & the range of delightful food options gets worse & worse."
6210,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Cons: Sushi was too cold and no taste at all, no real wasabi."
6211,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The sandwiches are average at best and I feel with a little more research I could have found something better.
6212,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I've definitely had better but I guess if you've never had them before and have no expectations for macaroons, you'd enjoy it."
6213,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Eh, this was unfortunately another lackluster meal at Wicked Spoon."
6214,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Cha shu bao--the dough and bbq pork both lacked flavor so all that was left was overwhelming sweetness
The mashed potatoes--they were pretty good but nothing to write home about

The rest of the stuff on my 4 plates (total) were just so-so miscellaneous nibbles and bites

We got our buffet free thanks to slot play using our Red Card\/ hotel room card but if I was paying, I would have felt compelled to cram A LOT more in my belly."
6215,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Hot dog,eh and fish sandwich not so good."
6216,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,In meat section we don't eat beef so we were hoping for some nice lamb chops or something but they only had lamb T-bone which was extremely tough and after struggling with it for few minutes we just gave up on it.
6217,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Their salad section is a bit weak and they have a lot of desserts, but the topping on all their creme brule was not at all very caramelized!"
6218,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The selection was mediocre and the execution of dishes was subpar.
6219,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Like other reviews, the food came out lukewarm for most of the table."
6220,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The entrees however missed several notes:

- Many of the dishes were way over seasoned this time: Korean Galbi, mushroom risotto, and cocktail shrimp."
6221,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I really don't wanna get into details about how bad the food taste it just was NOT good at all.
6222,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Overall 5 star atmosphere and patio area, 3 stars for the ""dinner"" food I'd give breakfast a shot."
6223,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Once inside, it seemed the quality of the crab legs had gone down a bit."
6224,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I cannot believe they offer this low quality buffet at a high end resort like this.
6225,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,All other foods looks really nice but it was not good at all.
6226,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I can never find a buffet with good sushi, their sushi sucked."
6227,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Afterwards, I went to the dessert section and it looked amazing, but didn't taste that amazing."
6228,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I had smoked salmon Benedict which was a little too runny for my taste, salmon was too little and hollandaise sauce was almost non existent."
6229,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I think there might have been actually like two or three beef slices, and like six fat gristle."
6230,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Everything was just about perfect from the service to the food except for my hamburger.
6231,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Food was heat lamp warm and it was okay.
6232,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,CONS: all the choices listed above seemed pretty average for the caliber of hotel.
6233,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I am glad I did have option to try 9 dishes as a couple of them fell flat like the mushroom carbonara.
6234,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,My husband stays upstairs and is forced to pay for cardboard food that we didn't even eat.
6235,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I've had better coffee at fast food restaurants.
6236,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Bottom line is: I'd only recommend if you want a stellar view of the fountains and don't mind paying quite a bit for okay food.
6237,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Well, the food was not nearly as good this time around...dish for dish, the Caesars buffet was far better."
6238,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,My food got cold because the buffet is so busy that you have to wait at each station.
6239,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The two types of fish I got were very dry and tasteless.
6240,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,There was no flavor AT ALL in the meatless dishes.
6241,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,This buffet is banned for life.
6242,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"This place had a lot of potential to be perfect but the food was a bit cold, some stale and what really killed the whole experience for me was how awful their macarons were."
6243,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,To add insult to injury the food at the buffet gave me quite the raging case of food poisoning which is not fun when you've got a 4hr car ride back to LA.
6244,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,A disappointment in service and quality.
6245,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The food doesn't even look appetizing to start with.
6246,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I didn't experience much of a ""wow"" factor with anything I had, whether it was the pasta (though Vermont cheddar is kind of neat - I didn't mind this), sushi, truffle-dazzled pizzas or anything else I tried off the buffet tables."
6247,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Didn't care for the food though.
6248,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"-Prime rib was better than the buffet at Paris and it was tender and more edible, but lacked flavor."
6249,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The scallops were sandy to the bite and had this disgusting bitter aftertaste.
6250,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The first bite was all gristle.
6251,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Although I've come to accept that regardless of the price, buffets are buffets, so you can't really expect too much out of the food quality."
6252,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Our only MINOR gripe was the potatoes were a bit bland, no big deal."
6253,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Not a place for kids who are picky eaters.
6254,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"went for brunch

only good thing about this buffet is that its $22 and comes with one free mamosa or champage, or bloody marie, if you're into that

presentation was very nice and creative, but it was very depressing to finally bite into the food and realize it didn't taste good."
6255,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Dessert tasted like it was cooked a couple of days ago.
6256,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,This food is not next day friendly.
6257,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The food (spinach and greens omelette) was greasy and salty.
6258,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"In addition, their sushi\/ Japanese station was disappointing."
6259,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The drunken noodle (pad kee mao elsewhere) were very pedestrian and nowhere as good as the drunken noodles we have had in Los Angeles.
6260,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Everything was deep fried so much so that every single 1 of us got sick after, with stomach ache, nausea, etc."
6261,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Everyone raves about the deserts the cakes were dry, creme brulee was ok."
6262,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The meat section was not that impressive.
6263,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"They had the usual buffet fare: crab legs (no knuckles), prime rib (really quite bloody with no medium cooked area), salad etc."
6264,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The fries were lacking, both in taste and in texture."
6265,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,They looked so good and really none were good at all.
6266,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Although the menu was creative and fun, the execution could use a little help."
6267,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,If you like massive portions and salt less\/flavorless food at a affordable price this is this place for you.
6268,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The only kind of crab they had was snow crab, which didn't taste that great."
6269,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,There were three choices: One was so dry that I had to drink water with every bite.
6270,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I never trust buffet sushi anyway, but the sushi really did not look good."
6271,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,They had crab legs pre-opened and freezing cold with the option to hear but when I ate them they were watery and bland.
6272,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Most of the breakfast items were cold and not very well prepared.
6273,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I had one of the worst experiences at this place.
6274,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Catfish was boiled and it would have been tastier seared for a bit before being added to the broth.
6275,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Why is it so hard to produce decent desserts at Vegas buffets?
6276,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The crab legs were good, but they were not seasoned and you had to flavor them yourselves.. so that is kind of a given."
6277,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Bellagio and Wynn are friendlier to my taste buds.
6278,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I thought the shrimp and oysters did not taste fresh.
6279,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"old and  awful taste pizza, old sushi, chewy prime ribs, a lot of dishes are tasteless, most of the dishes are basic, small dessert areas"
6280,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"We got seated right in front of Bellagio's water fountain inside, but unluckily, it started to rain so people outside have to kind of scoot the table in and ours were getting splashed by the umbrellas :[ 
I had one of the steak dish, it was cooked medium rare just like how I ordered, but it was a bit heavy on the salt."
6281,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The bigger meat dishes just fell flat and were a bit boring.
6282,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Cons: Chinese food is salty and some of the italian small dishes were cold, which was disappointing cause that eliminated two major food stations for me."
6283,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The Caesar salad was drowning in dressing which tasted like something you'd buy in a bottle from the local grocery store.
6284,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Obviously Gordon isn't the one cooking the food or managing the restaurants but my goodness there were rookie mistakes made at every turn.
6285,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,A lot of the other foods were not too great...
6286,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Noodle Section
Skip this one, it was the worst section in the buffet I think."
6287,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Foods is ok. Oysters is not fresh.
6288,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The sponge part (the sticky toffee part) was very authentic, but the ""salted peanut"" ice cream was not good at all - it really didn't taste of anything outside of icy milk."
6289,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I think the quality of the food has gone down since my last visit here and the price has gone up at least 25%.
6290,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The food was dried and tasted and looked like it was sitting\/cooking from the morning.
6291,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Everything else tasted old, I know it's a buffet but still, I've had delicious buffet food so I know it's possible."
6292,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,for food and spirits and finally walked out leaving a mininal tip after the waiter brought me an after dinner drink that was supposed to be hot....again...only mildly warm...and then I had to wait 15 minutes AFTER I was finished for the check...... ....it is a great location with cold\/lukewarm food and poor service....again...sorry I can't give this the reviews I read....just the truth here...maybe things will change....I felt disappointed.
6293,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I went on a Monday at 3pm, so probably not the most ideal time to see the freshest foods and most attentive staff, but less people to fight with to get to the food
2."
6294,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The roast beef on the original was extremely chewy though, and I had to spit out a lot of the meat."
6295,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,We had to wait an hour to get in and the quality of the food we waited for was terrible.
6296,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,(Not as good as our cold brew that we make at home but it was adequate.)
6297,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I expected more, the flavors were blend and to be honest, it tasted like something you could buy yourself at the store."
6298,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Bad food and even worse service.
6299,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I don't reccomend the regular food.
6300,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"(crab was difficult to eat and hurt my mouth ..:\/) 

$52 per person for dinner which includes soft drinks!"
6301,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The thick cut bacon was not nearly as good as the bacon at Bacchanal - it was not even thick and there wasn't enough smokiness to it.
6302,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The fried chicken however had a heavy sage smell which overpowered everything else about it.
6303,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"NOT worth the price ($45)

After waiting for an hour and a half, we were very excited to try the food but ended up so disappointed :( 

1st trip around, everything tasted like it was left out for too long or over cooked."
6304,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Dessert -- Gelato bar was awesome, but the gelato wasn't quite frozen enough to the right gelato consistency."
6305,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The dessert station was big, but didn't seem as good as I expected."
6306,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The desserts were absolutely atrocious.
6307,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"They also had a jook bar, which was a bit bland but unique for a Vegas buffet."
6308,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"There were tons of little bacon pieces, which made it hard to chew."
6309,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I associate buffets with lots and lots of middling-at-best food that has been slightly desiccated by the heat lamps and germified by fellow patrons who ladled from the vats of mediocrity before you.
6310,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The food was horrible - certainly not worth the price tag or the hullabaloo.
6311,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I've never had a sandwich I didn't like, though I'd say I could leave the salads I've tried there."
6312,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The food however, quite disappointing for the price, I ordered the all hail Caesar salad for $14 and what I received was a pile of romaine lettuce and a single crouton."
6313,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Why waste room in your stomach though when there's ALL that food?!
6314,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Even Golden Corral has more selection and better tasting than 5 star hotel.
6315,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The burgers were good but they weren't amazing.
6316,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,food is very cold.
6317,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I had a large number of dishes to sample...none of them inventive, none of them delicious and none of them memorable in any way."
6318,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"We ordered the chicken satay and agreed that it was the worst both of us have ever had (& coming from different cities, we've sampled our share of Thai food)."
6319,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"My food came out and the chicken was luke warm, granted I did request something different with the meal that could have made for a longer wait in the window."
6320,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I dunno I tried the food and for a Vegas Buffet, I dont think I would go here again because it wasn't memorable and the service we had was kinda poor, meat was over cooked, and the deserts were ok, but were of mediocre quality."
6321,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"As far as seafood goes, both cooked fish options that day (maki and sea bass) that I tried were totally overcooked."
6322,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,All the stuff looks pretty to look at but are really subpar in flavor.
6323,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,There is no reason a single human being should be consuming one portion of any dish here.
6324,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Sushi quality was pretty low and much the same for Chinese dishes.
6325,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The mimosas were made with cheap sparking wine and watered down orange juice.
6326,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"All in all, the presentation of mini offerings was nice, but nothing tasted spectacular enough for me to come back."
6327,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Sushi was just OK. Dessert bar was still very good but they started running out of gelato and were limiting the portions.
6328,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Huge portions, good service, prices were reasonable, but the food was nothing special."
6329,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I have no idea why this is a 4 star buffet, it's small and the food sucks, especially the Japanese and Chinese sections."
6330,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"It is nowhere close to a quality buffet - not in selections, not in taste and it's all about presentation."
6331,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Most of the food was bland and could have used more seasoning.
6332,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,We ate at TOM's URBAN before for earlier dinner which had A WAY BETTER BURGER for same price !
6333,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The prime rib was a tad overdone, even from the center, and the seasoning, which made for a good tasting crust, didn't penetrate to the center of the meat."
6334,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,but none of them are really good.
6335,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Food: The bread we got at the beginning of the meal was not warm and was so hard that we couldn't eat it.
6336,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The fried chicken wasn't great but I don't come to buffets to eat fried chicken.
6337,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Anyway, the food was mediocre at best, but the choices were so slim I was shocked."
6338,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Overpriced mediocre food.
6339,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,It was the worst bite of food I've ever had.
6340,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The products are not the same (don't get the BLT Mary at this location, it's a sad attempt at imitating the real one in SD), the vibe is not the same, money put into staffing is not the same."
6341,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,But save your money and time as this falls far short of those rumors.
6342,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The delicacy of items was also kind of lacking.
6343,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The price is expensive at $65 for 2 people for sub par food taste, quality, selection, ambiance, and decor."
6344,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I got the crabcake sandwich or burger or something, and thought it was kind of dry and over cooked."
6345,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The buffet at Bellagio had the selection but lacked flavors in most dishes, the lighting was dark and gloomy, the ambiance was dated, and the service...omg the service was horrible."
6346,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,we couldn't even bite the sandwich.
6347,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Pretty decor, and wide selection of foods but food quality and taste is average.."
6348,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I ordered signature Thai dishes to get an honest measure but they failed to even deliver the fundamentals properly.
6349,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The meh:  the pizzas were dried up fossils of something that might have been good had they not been sitting under heat lamps for extended periods of time, the bone marrow (though I'd never had it before, I just didn't see what Anthony Bourdain raves about when I tried it), the aforementioned mac & cheese bar is decent but I can make better at home, the beignets were also dry."
6350,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The main reason for my 2 star rating is the fact that I got violently ill at the restaurant about two hours after we started eating.
6351,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The only redeeming part of the buffet was their mac and cheese and their dessert.
6352,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The Asian and Italian dishes were all awful, and I tried multiple ones."
6353,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Use to be the BEST in town
Now the FIRST PLACE is BACCHANAL at caesar palace
I do not recommend anymore the buffet
You would be dIsappointed
We could have thought that after beeing so good they would have make a special effort at the apperance of bacchanal
It is the contruary
Chinese food is not varied and no good
Meat is very poor
Pizzas are awfull
Salads and vegetables with no taste
Deserts are a désolation
Ice cream a joke 
Used to be a huge fan no more !!"
6354,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The final nail in the Hash House coffin, the food aint that good."
6355,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The food was great but now as good as the people watching:) 
I woke up this morning to look in the review journal to see mon ami gabi recieved a c rating from the health district........maybe would have thought twice about the oysters and tuna tartar knowing this."
6356,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The selection of food was vast, but the quality of food was poor."
6357,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"However, the food quality itself and customer service still have lots areas that needs to be improved."
6358,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Until I came here for dinner the next day with my husband after I was raving about the lunch and we were insanely disappointed.
6359,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Everyone in line was complaining about the hot plates.
6360,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Nice buffet but nothing special.
6361,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"sorry GR, like your tv, dislike your food."
6362,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The food looks great, but when you take that first bite the food is eh..."
6363,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,They would have received 5 stars if the crab legs weren't lacking in flavor.
6364,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The crab fried rice was tasty but not enough crab.
6365,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"It is large and relatively diverse, but all of the dishes were fairly generic, and totally unremarkable."
6366,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"On the outlook the food looks impressive but having had other buffets, I felt the food choice and taste was actually a little disappointing."
6367,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,And the meat is not fatty enough.
6368,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Overall good flavors but way too salty for the italian sub.
6369,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"BUT, of the three entrees I've ordered at this location, the food was bland and forgettable."
6370,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Our final selection, the musaman curry with tofu was mediocre, but the highlight nonetheless."
6371,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"We got:

Pastrami Reuben - I really liked this as the flavor was definitely there but was disappointed when there was hardly any pastrami in my sandwich."
6372,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,In fact - they were quite bland.
6373,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The desserts were the final straw, they looked amazing but tasted terribly, seriously - inedible."
6374,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The bread was the only thing good about the meal.
6375,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Just don't appreciate the service they provide, and the food too, isn't as good as it used to be."
6376,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The problem is that it's not all that flavorful...underseasoned, no good flame or smokey flavor."
6377,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Just ok:
- Drunken noodles with crab: Most excited to try this, but the crab was disappointing."
6378,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Because there's not a worse feeling than paying good money for bad food.
6379,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"6) 


Lowlights:
1) Seafood: This selection was disappointing...the king crab legs were not very meaty compared to other buffets I have been to."
6380,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"skinny crab legs with hardly, to no meat."
6381,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Only for a specific occasion as the poor food quality, inconvenience of parking, no bathroom in the restaurant and lack of whimsical ambiance was not impressive enough to bring me back anytime soon."
6382,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,It's mediocre at best and we had high hopes.
6383,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Awsome view of Bellagio water fountain, very kind hosts
Steak is very bad."
6384,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The Fried Shrimp, Pad thai, Fried Rice all overly salty."
6385,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Great hangover food, but nothing gourmet."
6386,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Kind of bland
- Aparagus: Mediocre, nothing special 
 
Overall, i was a bit disappointed with this restaurant."
6387,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"It tasted chocolatey, but slushly like because I think there's too much crushed ice."
6388,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,a lot of things i took a bite of and didnt eat the rest.
6389,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"- When the food was brought out, it wasn't hot."
6390,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"For desserts, a lot of the smaller cake-like pastries are similar and not the best\/ worth trying."
6391,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I had their snow crab legs, and they were good, but not as sweet and juicy as the ones I had a couple weeks earlier in the Bellagio buffet."
6392,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The meat at the meat station were either too hard to eat (like dry and hard) or too salty.
6393,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The Jalapeno's had a good taste but no warning about them being boiling hot and they seemed fried within an inch of their lives too.
6394,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"However, as we ate with the lunch crowd we found all the hot dishes were room temperature and most of the food becoming stale."
6395,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Maybe people like s big pile of shredded meat with melted cheese but to me that's not corned beef hash.
6396,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I've eaten here twice and both times I was completely shocked by the amount of food on my plate.
6397,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,But the taste just isnt there for almost $70 a head after tax on a busy night.
6398,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,However I have been vomiting my innards out for the past 12 hours and it has to be one of the worst experience I've had yet!
6399,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,And the desserts - what few were offered - were no better than supermarket or Cool Whip-based quality.
6400,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Still happy with food, so many choices as usual, but not much taste, Bellagio buffet still has best flavors overall."
6401,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"For the price of $42, I was expecting most of it to be higher quality."
6402,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Now it's not different and probably a poorer quality and selection than other hotels on the strip.
6403,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,There's a good chance that last food poisoning I had was from this place.. probably the questionable seafood freshness.
6404,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The ""Asian"" good was a joke."
6405,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Try their premade salads in the little glass cups by the sushi, I got the poached pear which was amazingly paired with candied walnuts and some citrus, oh and the grilled corn on the cob!"
6406,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The pasta, though it was preportioned, was left out in little bits only to dry because of the heat lamps :( Most of the food tasted burnt and overcooked."
6407,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"i also love the idea of a mac and cheese station, but there really were no suggestions about combinations or any really unique cheeses."
6408,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Seafood (crab legs and shrimp) was served cold and was of poor quality and fishy.
6409,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Desserts nothing special I haven't seen at Mirage, Bellagio, Harrahs, buffets."
6410,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I didn't care for the rest of their desserts because it was way too sweet but the gelato bar was alright.
6411,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"My sister ordered the steel cut oatmeal with fruit, and as beautiful as it looked, it was poorly executed."
6412,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Their Asian cuisine tasted like a $10 buffet I can get at home.
6413,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"1 hour afterward I felt sick to my stomach and had diarrhea so, the food legit sucks"
6414,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,the shrimp were frozen cheap quality that look like they were thawed out and put on the bar.
6415,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The desserts aren't stellar but they do have chocolate dipped strawberries and a gelato bar.
6416,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I'm sure there's an alternative way to grab the fresh, sweet strawberries in the future."
6417,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,All of the food was cold.
6418,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,It was good but not as awesome as their chocolate waffle we had the day before.
6419,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The deserts were the prime example of presentation but no substance.
6420,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Had it not been for the saving grace of those onion rings, this meal would have been a disaster, especially given the price of the burger."
6421,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The salads were an every day type thing, nothing special."
6422,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,And avoid the Wynn until they up the quality of their offerings.
6423,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I got the fish & frites and the local market could do it better.
6424,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,They do have an area that serves sushi but I found this to be the lowest quality of the items on offer.
6425,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"And the fish is drying than a mf
Chinese - maybe good enough to fool non-chinese food lover...but none looked good."
6426,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The meat was generally dry, and the crab legs were really stringy."
6427,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The food is very bland.
6428,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The cake in it was not as good; tastes like cake you'd get in the grocery store.
6429,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I definitely noticed a downgrade of food offerings, diminshing food quality, and overall service was lacking."
6430,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Really good but the portions are ridiculously huge.
6431,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,No flavor at all.
6432,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The meat from the carver was dry.
6433,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,For some reason I thought the food would be a step up @ the Wynn restaurants but am unimpressed for the most part.
6434,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Place has the weirdest foods which makes it harder to order something DECENT.
6435,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"that horrible Tabasco sauce that Hooters use is also used here....go to Buffalo Wild Wings instead or get the Spicy wings at the Albertsons deli...(amazing) 
-Nachos: I didn't know it was possible to ruin Nachos until now, the canned black beans and dehydrated ground beef makes Taco Bell a 5 star restaurant....skip them and go to the Yard House for Nachos...best in Vegas (I'm not kidding) 
-Oreo frozen hot chocolate.....I know my junk food and let me tell you something...those are not oreos, they are some cheap version of oreos because it has that medicine after taste."
6436,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The salmon and another type of fish, they were not in great quality, I think."
6437,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The fruits tasted like water.
6438,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The portions here are pretty good, but the quality of the food is mediocre and definitely not up to par with their prices."
6439,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The Farm Burger absolutely pales in comparison to the Niman Ranch Burger from Evan Funke when he was at Rustic Canyon (still the best in my book).
6440,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Too bad the meat is burnt so my burger is slightly bitter =(  I couldn't taste the truffle oil.
6441,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"This buffet does not have much of a selection, and most of the food looked unappetizing."
6442,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I never had a food poisoning that bad.
6443,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The food overall is a bit salty but still my favorite buffet on the strip so I have to give it 5 stars!
6444,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"It's probably a cool place to eat while you can enjoy the Bellagio fountain, but the food was just mediocre, nothing really stood out and nothing really to be sad about."
6445,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The buffet was less than average, prime rib tasted like Chuck steak, crab tasted like it had been brined for years, NO cocktail shrimp or oysters for a $45 buffet."
6446,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The already super model skinny crab legs were cut in half lengthwise, the salads were wilted, and the sushi translucent."
6447,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,the ice cream was good quality but thats all I enjoyed.
6448,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,-The Dim Sum and Mexican dishes were also poorly executed.
6449,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The selection is wide in terms of genre (seafood, American, Asian, Italian, Mexican, Dessert) but with the exception of the dessert table, the options available were all pretty basic."
6450,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Though tasty, so greasy and made me feel sick for the rest of the night
- The presentation of the food."
6451,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"For one, don't let the long lines deceive you into believing that you're going to be eating some luxury food."
6452,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"There were 4 scallops, pretty big, but they were definitely over grilled that all I could taste is bitterness!"
6453,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I of course thought my boyfriend was exaggerating, so I took one bite and had to spit it out, and my mouth was on fire for the remainder of the evening."
6454,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I ended up only eating crab, but I can always eat that at any other buffet."
6455,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The chanterelles were great, but there were not too many of them and this premium ingredient was kind of lost in the sandwich."
6456,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The seafood rice dish was gummy.
6457,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,You cheated us out on your tastes and selections on foods.
6458,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I have to say that I was extremely disappointed at the quality of the food, the layout of the buffet, and the overall experience."
6459,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Eggs were runny and no flavor and the breakfast meats were just ok.  We had hoped that as they switched out breakfast to lunch that the selections would be better, and the answer was a HUGE NO."
6460,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The problem was I immediately seen is that the food was never that hot.
6461,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"We went to the Wynn buffet a couple days ago and it was not only cheaper, it was better tasting and nicer looking."
6462,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"We got there early enough during lunch that they were still making the made-to-order pancakes (regular ones and red velvet), good election of toppings but the actual taste and fluffiness was not what you would expect from a good pancake."
6463,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Experienced food poisoning at 3am, had to yack 3 times."
6464,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I spent over $50 on 3 different desserts and I I wish I had gone to a Haagan Daz or even McDonalds instead!
6465,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,It was just so pretty and nicely lit that sometimes you get fooled by how good your overall experience was just because the atmosphere was amazing... but decor aside.... the food was not up to par.
6466,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Oysters were pretty decent although it had quite a bit of shell fragments, but i know these gluttonous folks had those shuckers madly working away."
6467,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Their food actually has flavor!
6468,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I think a good strong cheese would have made this burger better and there were parts of the burger that did feel a tad greasy.
6469,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Unfortunately, when I ordered the mussels a lot of them were cracked and I was getting shells in my mouth."
6470,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,service is pretty slow and the food is just ok. the emphasis seems to be on volume over quality.
6471,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,There was nothing special about the desserts.
6472,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Either you got it or you don't and the food quality just doesn't match up with all the glitz and glamour.
6473,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I think the Bellagio itself is beautiful where as the food at the Buffet was just okay.
6474,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,It seemed more like a soup rather than a curry to me.
6475,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Our table discussed how they lacked that depth of flavor we look for and get at other spots less hyped.
6476,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The other 50% were usually either too bland or too salty.
6477,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Lots of options, but the food was average."
6478,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Better value and excellent food quality can be found @ The Wynn buffet (our fave), The M (offstrip and a great value), Mandalay Bay buffet are better choices\/value."
6479,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Most of the food items were smothered in some kind of fattening sauce.
6480,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The food is 'spensive, unappetizing, and the seating uncomfortable."
6481,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I was even disappointed in the dessert bar.
6482,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The hand-carved meat was dry and rubbery (You can't even cut the meat with the knives we were given).
6483,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Everything else was typical dry, cold, and crappy buffet food."
6484,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Potato soup-ok, but wasn't even that warm!"
6485,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Chocolate lava cake at the dessert bar was very dried out, like a brownie."
6486,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I thought with the Cosmopolitan Hotel being new and hip that the food would follow suit, but surprisingly it's meh."
6487,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The table next to mine didn't even touch their basket of fries.
6488,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"However, for the amount you pay, I'd rather be served a meal that they spend time cooking and amending if needed according to my taste."
6489,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The chicken was actually tender and good but needed flavor.
6490,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"So I would probably come back to nosh on some grub, but as for the frozen hot chocolate that Oprah swore by, I would kick myself if I order it again!!"
6491,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"After tasting the food I had waited so long for, and paid so much for (It was an Easter buffet or something at the time), I was really not blown away."
6492,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,But...the chicken was so overdone!
6493,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,She could not tell the prawn from the tail it was so stuck together.
6494,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"They ran out of King crab, so they served whatever was left from day before an blended in a very few pieces with the snow crab to fool the customer (doesnt work) and then they ran out completely."
6495,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The fries were horrible--some over fried, hollow weird-shaped things."
6496,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I decided to thumb through all of the reviews before posting my own because for one, I wanted to see what everyone else ordered that had this restaurant rated an average of four stars and two, it was imperative that I see how many Black faces were eating there because what ""I"" was served had absolutely NO seasoning."
6497,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Oh, the fish tastes stale and fake."
6498,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The side of frittas was too hard to eat for my taste and left it in the plate.
6499,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The lack of taste is uniformed pretty much regardless of what you order, I've sampled my family's food on previous visit and stole a bite off co-worker's plate."
6500,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"If you do choose Mon Ami Gabi, just simply order a bottle of wine and order the children's Mac n cheese and watch the strip without wasting time with the food that only the most unsophisticated tourist would find palatable."
6501,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"CONS: Service was very spotty with certain requests we made with the server, bacon was underwhelming, apple crepes were too sweet"
6502,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Although it was all edible, the food did not live up to my expectations."
6503,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Short Story-
Much of the food really was dried out or just not seasoned right."
6504,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The pasta didn't taste the same so my second visit was a bit disappointing especially after I paid $25 extra per person for not waiting for 4 hours.
6505,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The Ceasar salad looked better than it tasted.
6506,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I guess the most disappointing dish was the northern style tom kah kai.
6507,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The chicken was undeveloped and dry but even if I ignore the execution of the chicken I can't ignore all the old tasting canned or bottled mini corns that mostly made up my dish.
6508,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,They had a very small selection of it and they didn't taste that great either.
6509,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,It didn't taste fresh and it tasted like it has been out for quite some time.
6510,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,My friend sent her omelet back because apparently her food was cold and plastic-like too.
6511,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Honestly, such buffet price over $50 per person, I would expect it to be restaurant quality food instead of buffet quality food."
6512,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Basically a hometown buffet 2.0
Crab legs and dessert are the only reason for it getting 2 stars, and expect to wait an hour"
6513,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Overall the meal was OK but nothing to get excited about.
6514,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Although it was good, I can't say it was remarkably different than a lot of other Thai restaurants."
6515,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The food was so so, nothing stood out."
6516,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The second bite.... And a third... And man, how many bites is it going to take to make this burger taste good?"
6517,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Sprinkling dry Parmesan on top didn't make it any more glamorous, plus none of it stayed on when you picked up a fry."
6518,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,My friend ordered a Hennessy & 7up which he though was a bit watered down.
6519,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The Chinese station is Meh...
6520,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The Pad Thai was very dry and the noodles were crunchy as hell.
6521,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Dull and unwelcoming, like the food."
6522,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"All in all, nothing WOW'd me, and for $38, I'm not sure if I'd likely go back...but if you're looking for a traditional Vegas buffet to go to, this is still probably towards the top of my list."
6523,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The whole meal was salt less and me adding salt, pepper and hot sauce still did not make it flavorful."
6524,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"There's a crap load of dessert options, but they look better than they taste and was a disappointment."
6525,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"We also shared the pork bao buns and it was ok, but the pork belly needed to be cooked longer... it was hard to bite due to it being tough still, but the flavors were good."
6526,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I really want to give Wicked Spoon a 4, because of the experience -- but at the end of the day the food was really just A-OK."
6527,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,- Pig ear salad...total fail (you can't even crisp up the pig ears to add texture?)
6528,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I ordered the bacon, egg and cheddar sandwich for breakfast and it wasn't very good at all."
6529,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Most of the food was over salted and not very hot.
6530,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Their food is so-so...typical food you'd find at a TGIF or any other place that serves typical American ""bar food."""
6531,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The presentation and plating at this buffet were great, although most of the food looked better than it tasted."
6532,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Meats were dried and tough, sushi was not fresh, all others were just bland."
6533,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"They do have a salmon breakfast, but it isn't that tasty."
6534,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I understand making food in mass quantities can be difficult, but getting sick from food even one time is a fail in my book."
6535,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"While delicious, I felt that it was lacking some flavor."
6536,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Fast food quality sandwiches.
6537,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I'm not typically a fan of buffets, as I feel that I'm forced to overeat and I don't think I eat enough to justify the costs of a buffet."
6538,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,That said the food was rather bland.
6539,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Interesting concept ... little dishes of gourmet food ... but it really wasn't amazing or had me leaving saying wow by any means.
6540,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Honestly nothing special, food was okay but over priced like everything else on the strip."
6541,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I didn't finish my burger, I only had half of it and took the rest home, if it was that good i would of finish the whole thing and not leave any left over."
6542,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Besides those items, everything else was disappointment."
6543,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The food did NOT wow me at all and there are tons of buffet places with better quality food.
6544,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Dishes I wouldn't recommend grilled calamari (tough), sauteed crab dishes (any of them..too chewy and not fresh)."
6545,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I give Wicked Spoon the credit for food presentation but the food didn't taste as fresh.
6546,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Both restaurants over cooked their lamb.
6547,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,What I found was a fairly standard buffet with some very questionable food items.
6548,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Only thing missing were bacon and avocado, but purely because I looove those two ingredients on any burger or sandwich."
6549,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"That kind of thing doesn't bother me, but I would prefer my eggs to be cooked correctly."
6550,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I was slightly disappointed with the quality of the food, especially after hearing so many great reviews about this place."
6551,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Once you get past the bloody mary taste, it gets worse from there."
6552,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Moderately priced but with moderate food quality.
6553,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"i felt for this amount of money, the hype, the length of time, the mediocre service, and the quality of food, and lack of options- they deserve only one star."
6554,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"For example, the Chinese roast pork had crispy skins, but they were so tough that they were inedible; the snow crab legs were served cold, & they were the tiniest crab legs that I have ever seen w\/ more shell than meat."
6555,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The menu descriptions were far more exciting than the actual product - bland, with not very many ingredients (e.g."
6556,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I was expecting better crabs legs from this buffet.
6557,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The plates see dirty and I will nut drink the water.
6558,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Let me just say that the buffet looks really nice, they have great presentation however the food tastes bland and just not that good, if you are a vegetarian DO NOT go to this buffet, but my friends who ate meat also did not like the food here, so my review is based upon both veggie\/meat eaters perspective."
6559,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I don't know if the bread used was frozen and then thawed or if it was sitting out all night but it was so hard I couldn't cut it to save my life!
6560,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,He said the chicken had no flavor and very dry.
6561,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Oh and I was soo upset that I had to start a yelp account just to say how plain the food tasted.
6562,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The snow crabs and cocktail shrimp were average, you can't really saying special about them unless they were ridiculously fresh and plump, which they weren't."
6563,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"About the only bad entree choice anyone mentioned was the duck confit, which seemed to have about 1 ounce of meat on a bone, and not great flavor."
6564,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The best thing was the crab legs, but other than that rest of the food items were just average"
6565,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The portions are a great size but alot of the dishes lacked flavor.
6566,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The food was not fresh at all and many of the dishes I tried were overcooked.
6567,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The plating and presentation is amazing, but it's lacking taste."
6568,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Only liked two dishes there, prime rib and primavera pasta."
6569,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Unfortunately, the hot dishes disappointed."
6570,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Gross
Chinese food?"
6571,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The sweet potato fries which were $1 extra were stale and not fresh!
6572,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Also, I basically skipped all the Asian food because I felt like they weren't worth it for the buffet when I could eat something else."
6573,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Wow I paid 110 on Easter morning for old food.
6574,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The spicy salmon roll were okay, Bellagio $20 buffet definitely tasted better in that aspect."
6575,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"(-) Eating seafood at a buffet has never been something that I really enjoyed so the sushi was dry and worth space in your stomach, crab legs had a variety which was ok and easy to eat so you might enjoy that, and the ceviche was something to forget."
6576,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I mostly eat vegetarian, but while I was in Vegas I decided to splurge a little...I'm wishing I hadn't."
6577,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"While the presentation of the food (in the small little pans and pots) is impressive, the quality of the food is just OK."
6578,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I tried so many different items that I can't list them all, but nothing really stood out to me to be honest."
6579,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The fried dumpling wasn't as bad as frozen dumplings I guess that's all I can say about them, typical greasy deep fried potstickers, probably not worth the stomach room but if you're craving it, eat it, it will at least satisfy that."
6580,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"My experiences at buffets have proven that quantity compromises quality, which tends to result in an abundance of mediocre food."
6581,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I ordered the sage chicken eggs Benedict and the chicken was dry and tough, while the potatoes, eggs and bacon all were cold."
6582,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"My husband and I tried the red velvet and a chocolate one, and they didn't stand out nearly as much as the other items."
6583,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"However when I went to the buffet station, I was disappointed."
6584,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Pass:
- sushi - not good
- salads in the glass cups by the cold seafood section - only ok
- chocolate covered marshmallow - cute, but hard

They had all the staples, crab legs, shrimp, prime ribs, etc."
6585,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Some of the dishes were very dry(expected from an ""average"" buffet), some very salty....Ive had much better food at other buffets with this price tag."
6586,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Pretty decor and furniture, but food does not match up =(

Probably will not return unless a friend insisted on coming again."
6587,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I've had some amazing Thai food and can't say this was better than anything I've had in the past.
6588,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Service was awesome don't get me wrong just the food didn't live up to my expectations.
6589,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The food, unfortunately, is average."
6590,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I didn't eat anything from that section.
6591,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I was looking for that truffle taste and the good meat taste, but only got that strong blue cheese taste."
6592,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,All items here was also not very unique minus the spiked pineapple.
6593,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I'm used to that but when I sat down and saw old food on my fork I was disgusted.
6594,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The containers were hot to touch and the warmers were very warm, how then is the food COLD???!!!"
6595,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"We moved on, taking 1 bite out of everything hoping to find something worth eating."
6596,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I have a big pet peeve about paying top dollar for cheap food and this place is exactly that.
6597,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Not a fan is steak fries!
6598,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Again, food was simply average."
6599,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The service was really nice; the person making the tacos, for example, had a smile on her face the whole time :D
As for the food, I thought the meats were tender but nothing wowing."
6600,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The ceviche and other seafood options were bad.
6601,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,They had a slight yellow tinge in the meat and didn't taste very fresh.
6602,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Most dishes were cold and sad looking.
6603,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The panang curry taste like water lol.
6604,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Only give them two stars because they have decent dessert.
6605,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,for the price.... poor quality food.
6606,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The variety was okay but only a few dishes were up to par.
6607,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"They even called one of their beef dishes ""Kobe"" and Kobe it was NOT!"
6608,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I notified a manager about the cold food, and he did refund a meal for me."
6609,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,from But instead they found one angry and very sick clinical pharmacist and an even angrier critical care doctor having the worst food poisoning of their life.
6610,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,It's a shame that a yummy alaskan crab legs could taste so bland...
6611,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,No drinks.
6612,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I've had great food from all over the place and theirs was not ""that exceptional""."
6613,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"MISSES
- Risotto: one bite was enough for me."
6614,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The crab legs were sooooo tiny.
6615,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,They were much too salty and lacked crisp freshness (but they weren't unfresh either).
6616,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Asian section sucked worst har gow ever, sushi section was small and looked like cheap cheap sushi and the taste reflected it."
6617,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"It's not your typical prime rib, few types of pasta, pizza bar, salad bar etc."
6618,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Burgers were very dry and missing flavor.
6619,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Their desserts were so unique, so many things I've never seen or heard of... they all sounded and looked so delightful but none of them were..."
6620,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The dessert options aren't as great as what you'd find at The Wynn's buffet, but there are some head-turners."
6621,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The only disappointments were the wait to get in - over an hour (yes, it was soooo long), the table next to us got way more drink service and attention than we did, and although the desserts are extremely pretty, nothing really stood out as having amazing flavor and as something I'd go back for a second time."
6622,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I believe that it is an experience meant for mass-consumption of an unhealthy amount of food that is never truly spectacular and provides for a lackluster experience that is meant only to fill your stomach.
6623,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The selection of food was vast, but the quality of food was poor and full of MSG."
6624,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Most of the food was very bland which although is expected from a buffet, I'd expect more from the Wynn."
6625,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The fries did come out but before our water was served.. We went for the regular fries and were very disappointed.
6626,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The food was underwhelming at best.
6627,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Overall, I'd give this place 5 stars for friendly service and amazingly large and creative portions, but only 3 stars on taste that doesn't match presentation."
6628,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The pizza tasted like a frozen pizza from walmart as well as the wings.
6629,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Regretting my choice.
6630,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Honestly, the food is only OK."
6631,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Dessert flan didn't taste like custard, creme brulee was burnt."
6632,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Bland, processed foods.... Cafeteria like atmosphere with poor service."
6633,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I would have given this place 5 stars, based on the meat, but the seafood was not the greatest, nor the sushi."
6634,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Expensive, cramped layout, and the food is fair at best."
6635,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,None of them are any good!
6636,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The fries were SUPER salty and their dipping sauces did not pair well in my opinion with the fries.
6637,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,They were inedible without ketchup because they were so freaking dry!
6638,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Please improve your service and bring the quality of the food back up!
6639,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,They were nicely presented but I wish they taste as good as they look.
6640,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The food isn't worth it at all - none of the dinner items are decent.
6641,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Who gives a shit about the ""biggest buffet"" when it all tastes like crap."
6642,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"However, when your name is Burgr they shouldn't taste bland and be uninteresting taste-wise."
6643,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Salads were pathetic and wilting and seafood section was dismantled a full 20 minutes before the transition leaving it empty for that period.
6644,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"While there was a lot to choose from, there were only a few items that stood out to me: the steamed BBQ buns, the meatballs, the beef burria, crab legs and cocktail shrimp, and the coconut macaroons."
6645,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"It looks like it was made 20 minutes ago, but the mystery is, it's not like we waited that long for it."
6646,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Well they do have a lot of food to select from HOWEVER their Dungeness crab was really disappointing...it looked like something they swept up from the floor.
6647,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The sandwich fell apart on me and the meat tasted weird.
6648,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,They had crab claws which were not good.
6649,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I never miss the Tom Kha soup, Nam Kao Tod, Garlic Prawns, Khao Soi."
6650,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I think you can get a better value at the buffet, personally) and one star for food quality -- it wasn't terrible, but you can find better in Vegas, especially at that price point."
6651,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The food quality is worse than before.
6652,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I don't know if it's just about bad timing or this place really sucks.
6653,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The service was AWFUL and the food was a letdown.
6654,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Super fresh tasting, with a great combo of crispiness and gooeyness."
6655,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"And what a surprise that here, in this archaic mish mash of tired trashy tourist sin reeking of cheap vodka and regret, there lies a culinary palace in the most unsavory of places, but a landmark nonetheless, (and ever since it's small cameo on Top Chef, the hoards of tourists have increased tenfold, making wait times to over an hour at peak times)."
6656,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"For a girl who can eat, i found a whole section of food that was literally uneatable."
6657,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Roasted Curried Cauliflower was rubbery, mashed potatoes had big lumps, brocolli rabe was watery, sweet potatoes were entirely unseasoned, green beans were tough - yeah, I eat vegetables at a buffet."
6658,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"If I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt, then maybe their Monday lunch spread (holiday Monday) is more ordinary than usual."
6659,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"In Vegas, there are just too many choices to deal with below average food."
6660,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Maybe I should have asked for no cheese, as it may have enhanced the saltiness of the shrooms, but oh man!"
6661,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,It's really salty and not a lot of flavor.
6662,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I would not come back, considering the wait and the food quality, there's much better food options in Vegas."
6663,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The restaurant is impressive looking, from the decor to the mini skirted waitstaff, but the food itself let me down."
6664,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"In that comparison, the food was horrible."
6665,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Lemon garlic shrimp - 
Sushi - Not much selection and too much rice
Calamari - A little bit too salty for my taste
Crab Cakes
Ravioli
Angry Mac&Cheese
Salad - There was not much selection during this time

There was A LOT more food that I cannot think of."
6666,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,In any case the food was fantastic and I will be back.
6667,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"This was our fourth visit over the past several years and while we loved it the first three times, it's lost its luster due to a weak dessert section and a lack of quality and tasty dishes."
6668,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Japanese food included a few typical rolls and they were mediocre at best.
6669,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I would rather get food at a gas station.
6670,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The burger was a solid, good quality burger.... but no a $15 burger."
6671,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"We had eaten a combination of pizza like this before at a different restaurant, which is why we choose to go with this pizza, but it could not have been a more bland taste."
6672,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The best thing about this dish was the chicken, which wasn't amazing."
6673,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Now we can all say ""that's your fault for eating oysters..you knew the risk..stick to cook foods at a buffet..use your noodle..that's an isolated experience..1 star is kind of harsh, dontcha think?"""
6674,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,I love the decor and everything but its overpriced and the food is subpar.
6675,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,This was my third visit here (first was tourist then second and thrid as a local) and I was not impressed with the food at all.
6676,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,It was very sweet and bland and there was hardly any cheese.
6677,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"i ordered the brie burger, but took it apart because i asked for medium well, and it was more like medium and i prefer my hamburger meat COOKED."
6678,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I would rather have less selection, but high quality food."
6679,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"They had prime rib, several different kinds of fish, lobster ravioli ( you need to pick out the Lobsters in this dish), lamb, pan fried quail (not good at all - no taste and not very good texture even though it looked good), salads, kobe sirloins, etc."
6680,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Sushi options are limited and very average.
6681,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,They have very low quality food.
6682,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Great service, nice atmosphere, food is not at all my thing - big portions of mediocre carbs and grease."
6683,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I looked at all the pics by Yelpers of crepes and saw amazing creations, but my crepe guy was completely inept."
6684,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"We got strawberry rice crispies, and a few sub par chocolate cake items."
6685,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The service was poor, the coffee was cold, and the food was expensive and not worth the price."
6686,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Most items only got one bite from me.
6687,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The breeads were not fresh.
6688,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"They had a lot of options, but I think they fell short on quality, at least for lunch."
6689,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The desserts were average.
6690,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Had a taste of both and opted out..not tasty and didn't compliment my meal.
6691,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"bbq beef-dry and bad 
brisket- so damn dry
salmon-so dry 
the music-you will understand when you go."
6692,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Don't get the green tea shake, it tasted like ass."
6693,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Then the Burgers came out and wasnt cooked very well at all.
6694,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Where do you get off charging $50 bucks (after taxes) for crap ass buffet that's short on items during the holidays?!
6695,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Dessert also looked so impressive but only the gelato was decent.
6696,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The food was gross and unappetizing.
6697,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The good over all was ok but way over rated if you ask me.
6698,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"There was very little wait at 11 am, however when we sat down we were presented with a minimal brunch menu of about 5-6 different items and no breakfast style cocktails (I probably could have asked for a Bloody Mary or Mimosa if I wanted, but neither was featured on the menu.)"
6699,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"As far as food goes the variety is still there, but it tends to be drier, flavorless, and lifeless."
6700,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,We tried about 15 things & only 2 tasted good!
6701,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"KEEP IN MIND when you look for quality of food at buffets, you are looking at BUFFET FOOD, not minimal menu nice restaurant food."
6702,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Both of us ended up with food poisoning that night.
6703,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The japanesey salad in that section was also disappointing.
6704,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,So the 3 stars was for service and the fact that something didn't agree with us.
6705,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,They do however have the most food selection out of all the other buffets but the food quality isn't that great.
6706,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,It tasted okay and was filling.
6707,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"- Sausage (hard to mess up)
- Stuffing (I loooove stuffing but it was a bit dry)
- Sushi - was okay, but if they're gonna serve sushi and call it fancy, they're going to have to get a properly trained sushi chef."
6708,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Neither had anything but average flavor.
6709,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"We both shared the hawaiian bbq and the caribbean jerk chicken sandwiches (half and half) upon recommendations from ""the homies""..I must say the caribbean jerk chicken sandwich was on point and the hawaiian bbq was very sweet and both left us craving for more!"
6710,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Nothing seemed fresh, the food looked as though it was presented well, but tasted like stale leftovers (I hate leftovers)."
6711,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The food is served in huge portions but they don't taste extraordinary.
6712,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Dry, cardboard textured fish, wet, over-dressed salads, soggy pizza, and what I would consider a lack of choice."
6713,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The meat itself was not flavorful and the different ingredients didn't help the burger at all.
6714,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The surface of the dishes are already dried out.
6715,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Corn beef hash w a tiny egg: very cute dish, almost a one biter but had no corn beef, just a tiny egg over potatoes."
6716,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Make sure you sprinkle some salt on it.
6717,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,This might sound like a lot but I had to taste a lot of undesirable food too.
6718,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"This is not to say that this buffet does not have a great selection, as it does...but the food flavors themselves were left quite a bit to be desired."
6719,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Plus the food was cold.
6720,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Had quite a bit of options but again the quality wasn't great.
6721,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,We suspect the meat has problem.
6722,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,It's well designed marketing but I'd rather have a real deli with better food wrapped in butcher paper.
6723,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,We also ordered the crab drunken noodles and it was good but not as good as their garlic shrimp dish.
6724,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"With the presentation, I thought it was going to be SO DELICIOUS, but on the contrary it was below par."
6725,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Desserts were just ok. Chinese offerings didn't look great.
6726,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,At the seafood stand Halibut was dry.
6727,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The steak was the worst I had ever eaten across all American restaurants; it was hard to chew and the meat was over cooked.
6728,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Case in point, you probably don't want to go for the $5 prime rib you find in most places."
6729,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I like my crepe with ""heavy"" whipped cream but the chef couldn't deliver that."
6730,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"My fries were fresh, warm and crisp but it was so crisp (overcooked) that all I taste was a lot of hard crunch with no potato."
6731,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The oysters were not nearly as fresh and it was definitely a disappointment relative to our first experience at this restaurant.
6732,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"NO sashimi, there were only small tiny rolls-not even REAL rolls...more like Kappa Maki with overly soggy rice used."
6733,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The crab legs and shrimp both tasted fishy and the crab legs had ice crystals in the meat, the first prime rib roast they had out was massively overcooked and dry (even the center cuts), the second was done nicely, but they cut the most ridiculously thin slices."
6734,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The risottos, polentas, and some of the meats at the carvery were a bit salty."
6735,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,They obviously don't know quality food if that is their biggest topic to discuss.
6736,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,Pricey veryyyy pricey food should be warmer more hot seafood would be appreciative the waiters was extremely nice
6737,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"I grabbed a piece of fried chicken and discovered upon returning to my table that there were still feathers in the chicken...battered, fried and all."
6738,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,A bunch of mediocre food at $41 a pop.
6739,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Still on my quest for corn-beef hash that rivals Bob's diner in Manchester Center VT, My latest stop here appeared to have potential, however turned out to be somewhat disappointing."
6740,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,My only issue is it could have been warmer.
6741,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,It felt like I was in a old fashion diner and the food didn't quite taste the same.
6742,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The service was really bad, the waiter never refilled our drink, he never came by to check on us."
6743,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Takes too damn long to get my freaking sandwich that I would have probably passed out from my drunkeness.
6744,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"When we watched other wait staff, it appears their areas are too large, or that the managers make their jobs miserable."
6745,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,It was defiantly more crowded than our previous visit but that was to be expected since we went later at night and just for dessert.
6746,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Food is horrible, service and staff are awful."
6747,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The server just like 2 other times, was not very attentive and hard to find."
6748,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I felt the selection was lacking, service was slow, and the price just really didn't match up with the amount of sub-par food I was able to consume."
6749,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,They did not care that customers were listening.
6750,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,We had to get a hostess to refill coffee.
6751,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"In fact, the restaurant wasn't even CLOSE to being full, but we ended up waiting for SERVICE."
6752,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Which is even more of a reason it was so disappointing to receive the horrible quality of food and service the second time.
6753,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,She didn't apologize.
6754,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I'm looking around at waiters standing around, managers setting tables, dirty tables, and I can't get a drink order filled."
6755,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Basically our breakfasts were just ok, the service was, blaaaa, ok, nothing exciting."
6756,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I'm not sure if this is part of regular service or if it was because we were there for the event.
6757,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Everything was great, but the service was a step down from the service that you would normally get at the original."
6758,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I give it only  3 stars because the design of the restaurant is just ok, the service was worse than the American restaurant medium and we wait nearly thirty minutes our food and it was not crowd."
6759,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Food quality is better than average (best in Vegas), but service is horrible."
6760,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,After trying to make the best of it we became increasingly unhappy with the food and service and complained.
6761,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,This is not a family friendly restaurant nor do they have changing tables in their restrooms to change diapers.
6762,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The food itself was pretty good, but for time lost that could have been spent enjoying a meal together this place gets only two stars."
6763,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Just think of how many times this happens there they write down the wrong number making people wait longer than they should.
6764,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"If the food that I had was hotter, Prime Rib more tender, and the person at the caving station was nicer to me."
6765,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I left unsatisfied because I intended on stuffing my face and leaving with a full stomach, but that obviously didn't happen."
6766,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The only thing I would possibly say is an issue is that the service people may appear to be a little bit snippy when you're ordering a sandwich.
6767,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"We were approached by the manager Shawn, who could not have been more rude--he questioned why we cancelled the treasure chest ice dessert as they were making it---first off never ordered it just asked questions about it, told him the service was very slow with cold food and our boys were falling asleep."
6768,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,She comes to notify us our is ready just waiting on one plate and they cannot take out any food unless every plate is up.
6769,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"At around 2:30PM on a Sunday afternoon during the slower season of October, we were still quoted a 20 - 30 minute wait."
6770,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"During my experiences, I had to admit I was a bit disappointed at the service and the food."
6771,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Prime rib was tough, crab leg was salty, terrible service."
6772,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I wanted a smile, a welcome, something kind lol 

Price: Honestly, I expected to pay more."
6773,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The desserts were a disappointment as I know it is one of their strengths yet the chef was not able to tell me which ones contained nuts since my wife is deathly allergic.
6774,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"We had tons of finished plates and when we came back with new plates of food, there wasn't any space to put them.. 

Other than that, my tummy was very satisfied!"
6775,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Food also took a good amount of time to come out... the couple sitting beside us didn't get their food until a good 15-20 minutes after we sat down.
6776,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I mean, it's a sandwich, should it really take so long?"
6777,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,80 min wait + $76 for a holiday dinner.
6778,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,So me and my cousin arrived at Serendipity and we see a long line outside as well as an empty seating area.
6779,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I waited for 5 minutes in front of the counter and nothing done.
6780,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"And the waiter overcharged my friends credit card by $20 or $40, i don't remember which one."
6781,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"However, I will now only go during non-peak hours or when it's not ridiculousy busy and I'm not starving."
6782,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The bussers stroll around with big smelly carts with food leftovers between the tables to collect dirty dishes.
6783,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,They let a few people every 5-10min it seems pay and wait to be seated.
6784,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The restaurant staff was not helpful in speaking to him to try to retrieve it or doing much else.
6785,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The staff were some really unfriendly females, who didnt wanna hear any questions about anything from sober people like myself, I guess cuz drunk people were all around us."
6786,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Staff ignores you.
6787,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?userid=Fy71pENHo8QeE39MO55ZDw&select=iH-IwkAfh0gtGqFF23fCjw 
I am not sure if you can call ahead and place a phone order but that might be a way to avoid the longish wait."
6788,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"My only complaint was that they seated us in the bar area of the restaurant which was really crowded with people around the bar, I would think they would sit us in the main room since we did have reservations."
6789,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,seating takes too long due to lack of experience.
6790,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"This was a very busy evening, and after a two and a half hour wait, was uber disappointed."
6791,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Only downside was the service, which was a bit slow."
6792,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,3) service - they obviously want you to leave right after you finished with your dish.
6793,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,We inquired as to the wait (we were not greeted or anything) and the host didn't even look up and told us 25-40 minutes.
6794,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The only negative comment would be the wait (1.5 hour )and waiting area (small)
6795,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"However, if you want to sample a number of different items, want some quality with your quantitiy, want to stuff yourself on nothing but crab legs and shrimp, desire a fairly nice setting, don't mind the wait, and are stuck on the Strip, then the Wynn buffet is a serious consideration."
6796,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,After a reasonable wait for a table- it is cool that they text you when your table is ready - we sat at a very cramped table in a VERY loud room and waited some more.
6797,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"It is a large buffet so the star, but the food is not fresh, the price ridiculously expensive, the horrible service the waitress spoke all the time doing nothing with the ones at the next table and without filling the glasses."
6798,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Once your 20 minutes were up, you greet the hostess who will take your reservation and tell you to wait in another line."
6799,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,It was a pretty chilly night and they had the doors wide open so I was freezing.
6800,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"After reading the other yelp reviews, I was worried the service wouldn't be great."
6801,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"They seem to not be very good at keeping the lines moving and had two ""specialty"" lines that took priority over the general line we were in."
6802,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Nothing special ... Food not hot service not good at all there are baby better buffet
6803,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Despite the long wait times, now they even automatically add 18% gratuity for part of 4... And the service is bad, rushing you to finish your food..."
6804,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"When we were all there, we were told it would be another 15 min."
6805,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"As it was, I waited a good hour on my feet, plate in hand, just for a chance to SEE what foods were offered!"
6806,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The hostess was not nice at all, and we waited for over 30 min to even go inside and the place was not even close to being half full."
6807,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Things to know before you go (for the better buffets):
*expect a long wait time (we waited an hour at lunch time)
*limit yourself with the breads & carbonated drinks-they'll fill you up!"
6808,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Only waited 15 minute to be seated but 30 min before we go our food.
6809,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The line got really hot either from all the people in line or the flames right by the line... Not such a good choice.
6810,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The waiter was asleep or did not care.
6811,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The waiter should warn customers about the spicy level of their food!!!!
6812,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,However due to a profusely incompetent hostess I did not have the opportunity to give this restaurant a chance.
6813,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Wait was listed to be an hour and we waited just shy of that.
6814,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I've never had an incident ever in my life with a waiter that didnt want to be there, didnt want to write four extra words onto his order ticket, forgot to fill waters, doesn't check on us at all (except at first when only half of us had our food), and takes 20 minutes to figure out how to split a 6 person check in half."
6815,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"As all the others who came in 20-30 mins after us began to get there food before us, it was kind of annoying."
6816,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Didn't really refill our waters, maybe just once 

Atmosphere: 5 stars- clean and nice environment."
6817,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Their service is poor.
6818,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I have been here half a dozen times and the only complaint i have is that the restaurant was short staffed twice when we went, causing a long wait at the bar even though we were the only ones sitting at it."
6819,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,LinQ should really look into hiring more polite people & maybe do a check up once in awhile.
6820,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,This is the worst service I have gotten in any restaurant I have been to.
6821,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Also what appeared to be some of the upper management people were running around like secret service with their earpieces but they don't acknowledge patrons either.
6822,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,There were several times where we had stacks of plates just sitting in front of us while the server just casually walked around carrying drinks or just 1-2 dishes on his tray.
6823,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I understand its a buffet but the lady assigned to our table was hardly available to bring more coffee and pick up the empty plates.
6824,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"You expected this girl to think your burgers were off the hook and make you my number one burger place in Vegas with this week old meat,  Skimpy toppings and awful service."
6825,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"(Bigger guy with a colored tattoo on his right forearm)
I know we got here late but that is no excuse for the service."
6826,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The service was poor - they went for the buffet with the champagne and it isn't really much of a champagne brunch if you have to beg to get champagne.
6827,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"They're busy, the waiter\/waitress doesn't come by too often, the food takes a while, my friend has told me stories of them forgetting dishes and\/or bringing out some dishes an hour later than others."
6828,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I did have to wait for my beer which I saw the bartender set up on the counter but the waitress took about 5 min to pick it up and bring to me, not sure why because she picked up other drinks just not mine."
6829,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Our plates were piling up and our drinks were not filled.
6830,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Heads up that they not take reservations for the outside seating, indoor only, it is first come first serve."
6831,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I don't appreciate paying full price for a buffet up front and then being forced to wait on purpose for our meal.
6832,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"There was a long line next to the fire wall to get in, if you gonna go, make sure to bring someone that has a Diamond total Rewards card :)."
6833,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"(Good luck waiting in the actual line after the line for BUYING)

I am a picky eater, but not to the point where I can't enjoy at least some of the food available at a buffet."
6834,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The food was decent (better than average) but the price was absurd ($34) and the line was long.
6835,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,A bad attitude too.
6836,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Long story short, I would never return there and strongly advise others against it as well, the only reason it gets 2 stars is because the food was decent, service is terrible and aside from the general manager, management was very unprofessional."
6837,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Not a huge fan of buffets so not really sure why I came... the wait to get in was ridiculous as usual (40 min?)
6838,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"3.5 stars - food is good but service is spotty

We are here for a conference and took a customer for lunch."
6839,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,My disappointments arose from the service.
6840,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,After waiting in line for almost 2 hours after the time we got in the queue system I have had better food at $15 Chinese buffets.
6841,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I knocked it down two stars because the flavor has been knocked down to fit farang palates and the service is stoic and unfriendly.
6842,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I came on a Monday and luckily only had to wait 10 min (I think my review would have been less stars if I had to wait over an hour for this).
6843,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,we waited 15 minutes while they prepared our table in a half full dining room.
6844,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"We again did not see any of this in the fine print, so we asked our waiter to ask his manager, who after 10 minutes visible begrudgingly came out and said yes we could use the Groupon for anything."
6845,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"- When it came to splitting the bill, she double asked if we were sure that we wanted to split the bill... as if it was so hard..
- Not mentioning how many times we had to ask for bread again before it finally gets to the table."
6846,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The server ended up bringing me a piece of bacon wrapped in a napkin.
6847,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,This is an issue that could easily be solved by giving the hostesses standing outside the restaurant the ability to check in people with reservations instead of standing in line.
6848,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Dozens of waiters and staff walked by and didn't even bother to clean it.
6849,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Our server had left!
6850,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I ask for it and the waiter looked confused.
6851,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The service is slow an the food is awful this was my third visit and every time the service and food kept getting worse!
6852,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,One the negative side was the service.
6853,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"A lot of people always go here and willing to waiting, just to have good and worth it buffet."
6854,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,This is a pretty fun little place - if you like waiting for 45 minutes and then another long wait for the food to come out.
6855,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Too long of a wait for just desserts..
6856,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Service was slow but I guess I expected it.
6857,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The only thing is that there is a long wait to get a seat so you might want to go to another location.
6858,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The wait was like 2 hours!!!
6859,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Service was bad, the food quite tasteless but nice decour and location."
6860,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Plus the service was horrible.
6861,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,We never had to wait long for our food or asking for condiments.
6862,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Again, bad management."
6863,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,We approach the buffet area to see mass chaos.
6864,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"We went up for a second round, came back to the table 10-15 minutes later (yes, buffet is that extensive) all the dirty dishes glasses, etc were right where we left them."
6865,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,You have to yell to place your order!
6866,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"this is a very well amazing place, the ONLY PROBLEM is the wait
be advise.."
6867,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The employees seem to hate their lives.
6868,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,More expensive food items were often slow to be replenished.
6869,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Be patient, it is always crowded and service is not that good (the food is, though)."
6870,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The Last time,  the server was a bit ""roll the eyes"" attitude but non the less I enjoyed the dining."
6871,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,My problem lies with the damn salt content and the server being incognito.
6872,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Overall, this buffet had some high points and low points...I didn't mind the lack of service TOO terribly since I didn't pay for the buffet, but I would have been pretty annoyed if I had."
6873,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"So despite the crappy service that we received from our waitress (going to contribute it to being holiday season and her having to work an entire section to herself), this is the best buffet that I've had in Vegas and I've been to a lot of them."
6874,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,My experiences have often started with an unpleasant and often somewhat confused hostess.
6875,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,seriously overpriced IMO but there was enough takers for the dinner meal to cause a 45 minute wait on a Wednesday.
6876,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,You could tell the waiter didn't really want to be there.
6877,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,My boyfriend asked for a quiet area so the waiter sat us in the corner of the larger dining room.
6878,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I love tipping people but I'm sorry I couldn't tip him for the way he was waiting us that night.
6879,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Great food, great service, and if you can catch a spot on the balcony great people watching."
6880,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,But there was no way this place deserves 4 or 5 stars for the unwelcoming service we got.
6881,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The hostess eventually came around to take our names and told us that it would be about an hour wait.
6882,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I like to have a cup of coffee with my desserts at buffets but since our server was MIA I couldn't even ask for one.
6883,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Service was alright, a lot of servers but being so busy, it was ridiculously hard to get our server when we needed them."
6884,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Super slow service !!
6885,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"We eventually got seated and the service was decent, could have been better."
6886,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The atmosphere is cool but the wait is about 20-25 minutes for a party of 2.
6887,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Also, although they made crepes at the station, the guy there rushed us through like we were in an elementary school cafeteria."
6888,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Again, my brother never raised his voice and I hear Benjamin telling my brother ""dude lower your voice do not yell at me."""
6889,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"* Lox
*French Toast

* ALL the gourmet deserts
My faves were the chocolate Tiramisu cups and chocolate covered strawberries


Things that were blah
* The wait was ridiculous over an hour
* I drank 6 Bloody Marys and should have been buzzed
* A couple items were mediocre, but the really tasty ones made up for those ;)"
6890,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The food was just as good as before, but the service was ehh this time around."
6891,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Totally worth the wait at the restaurant!!
6892,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I am so dissapointed, food is good but service is super bad, and when you get a bad service, it is more likely that you never go back to a place."
6893,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I wont ever go back, I can get way better food for $44 and wayyy better service and not have to wait as long."
6894,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I didn't get to try the prime rib because the guy who was in charge of that station was tweeting out or something when he was carving and was MIA most of the night.
6895,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"And, the restaurant appeared short staffed because it was difficult to find our server to refill our drinks or have our plates taken away."
6896,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Decor at this restaurant is pleasing but the wait is a sore unless you are lucky enough like I was to cut ahead of everyone in the Diamond lane.
6897,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,We tell him we were here for Restaurant Week (because there is a separate menu) and he had no idea what we were talking about and made that very clear in a rude manner.
6898,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Customer service is horrible - except Mr Carlo behind the crab legs\/craw fish area.
6899,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"But be aware of the popularity, the wait, and time you'll take for your frozen treat."
6900,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"So minus a star for disgusting dry quiche, and another for subpar service."
6901,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"It wasn't the line that I was most upset about (I don't mind a long line if my food is good) well with that being said, our pretzel wasn't all that great, it was hard and cold."
6902,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Upset now bc I walked there, waited for food and had to walk back."
6903,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The wait for this buffet can be up to an hour, but trust me it's actually worth it."
6904,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"In fact, we thought the food runner served our table much more than Melissa."
6905,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"That being said, I will most likely not be visiting Bacchanal again because the service was absolutely deplorable."
6906,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Food was eh, nothing amazing that would make me change my mind about the poor customer service."
6907,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"And after hitting up Earl, while it was organized, I probably waited just as long for my very inexpensive sandwich than I would have for a gourmet burger."
6908,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"It might be difficult and often times challenging to get into the restaurant because there's usually a wait, and people shuffling to get in or get out."
6909,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Perhaps you pay for the ambience and experience when you sit in the restaurant, but the to-go line is a definite no-go."
6910,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The hostess that informed me we no longer had a table really didn't seem to care and was not apologetic at all.
6911,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"fucked up my breakfast experience.. bad service slow service, others came after us and ate and finished before I got my meal."
6912,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"This place is located inside of Plant Hollywood when we walked up, there was a long line."
6913,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"At the end of the day food was great, service was sub-par Gordon should have been there lighting a fire under their Ass!"
6914,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"They should remake the food selections ASAP

Pros:
* Locating in Cosmopolitan
* Their desert is the only thing good there
* They put many of their food in small cup\/pan\/pot

Cons:
* For the subpar food selection they offer right now, $40+\/person is a ripoff (Don't come here if you like seafood, their selection is very limited; they use crab legs the same level as those in $15-$20 asian buffet places)
* Most of their food doesn't taste like $40+ buffet, it was so plain and basic
* Their ambiance\/decor can be considered ""OK"" if it locates elsewhere not name Cosmopolitan, but for such an upscale trendy hotel like Cosmopolitan, Wicked Spoon should spend a little more money on the restaurant's ""vibe""
* Our waiter was discriminative."
6915,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Rhonda the buffet manager was very rude with our party.
6916,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The food was quite good but for the price I would expect better service.
6917,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"If I ever visit again, I'll probably choose to wait a bit longer for a better seat."
6918,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,We all thought the yelling was unnecessary especially in front of customers.
6919,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Also, I get that I was there on a 3-day weekend, but I still ate on a Sunday and had to pay $50.. not to mention that our waiter especially took a really really long time to clear our plates and fill our water."
6920,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"We left encore beach and were refused entry, looking more sophisticated in a tank than any of the slobs in tee shirts."
6921,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The servers were quick to get our drinks at first but not the best at refilling our drinks and taking away the plates.
6922,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Wait time was crazy, crazy long, but we enjoyed our food (it was almost noon and we hadn't had breakfast yet) and bloody marys, although they could've used a bit more spice."
6923,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The wait was long for a table and the food was slow to come to the table.
6924,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Great selection, -2 stars for horrible service!"
6925,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I'm going to be honest in saying that the burgers took a while to come out.
6926,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Burger came with everything I requested not to put on it.
6927,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Horrible food with worst service ever.
6928,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"On the negative side, the sandwiches are a touch on the small side and service was kinda painful."
6929,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,For the price you pay the service should be up to par.
6930,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Nice place
Take a very long time to be seated because its so busy there, but its worth the wait in vegas price is decent plus so much food you can take back to your room for the next day..."
6931,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The server wasn't able to give us a recommendation on wines.
6932,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I hate lines- especially for breakfast but we heard it was an amazing buffet and this was our last day... so we decided to stay.
6933,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The wait:
- around 40ish minutes at any given time throughout the dinner period
- i went on a monday night around 9pm and it was definitely busy
- it was around 40 min wait for a party of 2

The service:
- my server was fairly...indifferent
- he wasn't cheery, nor a downer...he just kind of did what he was supposed to do, minus he didn't offer to refill our drinks."
6934,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Generally the wait is RIDICULOUS come lunch time if you don't have a reservation...so if you want to come for lunch, make sure you call in for a reservation beforehand!"
6935,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,One thing I was not impressed with and weighed heavily in giving this establishment a 3 out of five stars is the fact that I was unimpressed with the service.
6936,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I had enough of watching this and asked to speak with the manager of the horrible service experience yesterday.
6937,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The atmosphere is buzzing and there's always a line to get in.
6938,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,My biggest complaint of the whole experience was that my food took forever to come out especially after everyone in my party was already served.
6939,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Both were great, you also get a fresh baguette, you will want it to sop up the juice from the mussels, my favorite part 
The only downside was the waitstaff, they were all hanging out in front of the bar, literally two feet from us, but never checked in, and it took forever to get our check."
6940,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Not the biggest deal in the world - but when your table is full it does get a big messy.
6941,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"By the way, they will add an 18% mandatory gratuity to your bill if u have 8 or more guests and the waitress doesn't even serve soft drinks."
6942,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"My fav all time brunch plate...yes the lines long and it takes 4ever to get a table at times, but its food is amazing...the fried eggs benedict is the most amazing breakfast item I've ever had (I've had it several times and its always been relish... the juevos ranchers believe it or not r the only juevos rancheros I'll ever eat..and lastly the original frooozen hot chocolate is a sinful treat very chocolatey"
6943,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,He even explained that they don't use heat lamps and that everyone 's food would arrive at different times as it came fresh out of the kitchen.
6944,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Overall the food is above average, but while the waiter was initially very attentive and even came back around to ask us how our food was, he neglected to refill our drinks upon request and didn't take our plates away."
6945,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The only reason why we didn't give it a 5 star rating is because the wait for the food was very long!
6946,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I think they must go through a lot of training in service etiquette.
6947,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I would think a restaurant on the strip in Vegas would be ready for a high turnover of new business and train staff to welcome new guests and help them through the process, this was a complete fail."
6948,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"For us though, the surprise wait was the kicker that basically put us in a bad mood for the evening."
6949,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,It's annoying that the wait can be long and I really don't like the seating options they have - but the food is so amazing.
6950,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,and he proceeds to tell me that Benjamin isn't quite getting the picture of what good customer service should entail and that at this point he is being an asshole.
6951,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Our food took at least 45 minutes to arrive.
6952,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"While the food was okay, the service was horrendously slow."
6953,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"One for us regular folk, and one for what I'm guessing are people who sign up for players cards at the hotel, but not 100% sure since there wasn't any explanation."
6954,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,If I'm paying 50 dollars for two burgers and fries and a couple of cokes I want good service or at least average service.
6955,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Plus you're in Vegas at the shops, so there are tons of things you can do while waiting for your food, though it doesn't take long at all."
6956,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,They were very slow at moving the line and the staff were not very forthcoming or putting forward good customer service.
6957,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Service is definitely an issue.
6958,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Service was actually on the poorer side even for a buffet and there was long pauses between glasses being refilled, although plates were removed in a timely manner."
6959,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The only time our waiter was a little nicer was toward the end of the meal, in hopes of a great tip maybe, UH NO you get the minimum and be glad you did."
6960,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I don't know about anyone else but in my book that is truly bad customer service.
6961,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"We had reservations and there was a huge line if pep without reservations waiting to get in .. One if our party members stopped at t hostess outside , where she was told to go to end of line even tho she had reservation !"
6962,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,After us there was a whole lobby of people waiting!
6963,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,But then she was pleasant when she gave us the bill.
6964,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The service, it's like omg, I checked in at 4:24 and the ticket said we can come back at 8:20, then I asked the server if we can just leave and come back, she said of course we can, so me and my girlfriend left to shop and came back at 8:30, I asked the server where do we check in, she said we have get wait in line which we take another two hours she said, what the fuck is the point of letting customers getting the ticket?"
6965,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Also, service is cold and mediocre."
6966,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Before that, one of the servers took away the iPad that they give you to place your dessert order without asking the adults or anyone at the table if we placed our orders."
6967,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Not saying its bad at all, but just that service is not the highlight of the restaurant."
6968,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"By the time the 2nd plate came around, I had no more to eat."
6969,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I understand a small delay while clearing breakfast, but I should not have to wait until 12:00 for the ribs and other specialty meats to arrive."
6970,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I was starving, having walked down the strip for something like half an hour (I swear, everything in Vegas is deceptively far away) then waited in line for another half hour."
6971,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I expected much better service from the Wynn.
6972,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Then we had to go to another line to wait to get into the restaurant.
6973,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Theres not ALOT of selection and theres always a line to get food.
6974,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"My friend ordered the Cotton Candy Martini and his reply was ""That's gonna be a very sweet drink and I got the impression that he really didn't want to serve this drink, but she said yes she would like this drink and noticed a reluctant expression on his face."
6975,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Also, observed a bus boy fling a wet rag across the room to another bus boy, (who looked shocked and embarrassed) Getting coffee took hand singles and a flare gun."
6976,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,It wasn't and maybe that's when i should have said something but the guy didn't really seem like he cared what the answer was.
6977,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Always full of customers in line to get in..  Good thing I had my players card..
6978,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,HARD to get in unless you are a platinum + gambler at Hard Rock\/Paris\/Ceasers chain.
6979,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Lines are a hassle, though the value is about there for a Vegas buffet."
6980,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"We sat down, our server came and greeted us about 5 minutes later & took our drink order."
6981,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Over priced omlets\/salads, took the food about 45 min."
6982,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The downside: Service.
6983,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The service was average, nothing stood out."
6984,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"We would have gotten much more genuine, sincere, and more polished service from deli, than from this poorly managed and utterly rude establishment."
6985,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The food was good but not exceptional and the service was absolutely terrible for the price point.
6986,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Upon questioning the server, I was told that their goal is to have all food delivered within 30 minutes of the order and she checked and it had only been 40 minutes since our order, but she would speed it up."
6987,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"And Benjamin stands there with a huge smile on his face and says to my husband ""have a great night, you're not eating at BurGR"" which infuriated him even more, I honestly had to pull my husband away because I knew if we stayed there 1 more minute Benjamin would have found himself passed out on the floor with all his teeth missing."
6988,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The crabcake sandwich that my friend had was pretty good though... 30 minute on what appeared to be a restaurant with plenty of open seating, which was somewhat frustrating, but that's Vegas..."
6989,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Three hours of waiting time  to eat something here.
6990,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,For the wait and the food I wouldn't come back here again.
6991,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Despite the fact that the restaurant was not very busy (there were other patrons, but the majority of them already had their food), we still waited 20 minutes for a server to even take our drink orders."
6992,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"As a ""Diamond"" service very poor."
6993,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"So RUDE, and definitely NOT enough time to eat your $51 worth of food."
6994,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I was kind of baffled about that since I have never been to a buffet where they want to take your photo and you have the option of purchasing the photo as a souvenir.
6995,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Food good, service sub par."
6996,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The wait sucked (the line was short but we still had to wait for 30-45 min at 8pm) and the waitress spilled stuff on my jacket when she dropped a plate (oops).. but the staff was nice and they tried to fix the situation right away.
6997,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The service, however, leaves much to be desired, beginning with  the hostesses seating people, and to a lesser extent, the waitperson at the table."
6998,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,My one complaint is what the hell if up with the outfits of the hostesses.
6999,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The service is still as rude as the service at New York City.
7000,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Service is mediocre, decor pretty mundane and the location kind of creepy but the food more than makes up for it."
7001,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Holding on to my last two stars for the long-ish wait for the food itself, the griminess, and the lack of options for breakfast."
7002,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The employee ringing us up wouldn't even look at it!
7003,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The ambiance was amazing and there was a humongous line just to get in.
7004,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,They definitely need to be told that they're all incompetent nincompoops at this location!
7005,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,She seemed to have disappeared during her shift so I never got any refills of my drink.
7006,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,And another big thing ....keeping the areas clean.
7007,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,A disappointment in service and quality.
7008,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The food is still top quality, which makes it all that much more disappointing to wait."
7009,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I would recommend calling ahead for reservations as this place tends to become very busy and crowded.
7010,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Service is a bit slow and when you are drunk, hungry and sleepy...this isn't a plus."
7011,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Oh yeah, the downside was the 2 hr wait on Monday night and the 30 minutes wait for the food after we ordered."
7012,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The three ladies and I were seated in a small and cramped circular table, much too small to occupy 4 large (and must I say, very large) dishes."
7013,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,No server came back  to check on us.
7014,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"So now we are in line, which starts after the hostess stand we wait another 10-15 mins to get up to the counter to pay."
7015,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Well worth the wait for an outside Patio seat!
7016,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"While we were quickly discussing our options, she continued to raise her voice and interrupt us in an effort to get our attention and see what we decided."
7017,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"One more thing, since Thai is known as country of beautiful smile, I wish I could get food with service of little bit of smile seasoned with."
7018,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The entire place is very stylish, from the open kitchen feel of the buffet itself, to the modern, off-kilter stark white square plates and bowls."
7019,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,All the dishes were fantastic-and to think that Thai food couldn't get any better!Customer service can be a bit more accommodating but the food well makes up for it.
7020,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I then told a manager about the issue and all he did was give me his business card and to call if my son had any problems.
7021,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Although the food at Serendipity was certainly sweet, the service was not."
7022,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The food and atmosphere somewhat made up for the poor service and seating we were given.
7023,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I could understand not being seated, but the rude tone and nonsensical retort that they can't even give you an estimate on wait time got things off to a poor start."
7024,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The restaurant started getting packed and 30+ minutes later, we still didn't get our food while everyone else that got there after us did."
7025,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The restaurant also mixed up two of our dishes, and we ungracefully switched our main dishes so we could get the right sides."
7026,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,But she made it sound like we were intentional free loaders who were looking for free food!
7027,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Minus one star for slightly rude service, but I guess I shouldn't expect too much from a buffet."
7028,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,For $54 you can get a much better meal in Vegas and not have to stand in a line for an hour.
7029,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I spoke with the Manager and told him I would not be paying for this cake as it is not what we agreed on.
7030,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Our server was nowhere to be found so I had to ask a busboy who was passing by.
7031,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Add to that the fact that the waitress was almost non existent and we will not be back.
7032,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"This is from my experience on 10\/18\/2016

3 stars for lack of quality of service, attitudes of people working on the property, but the food was worth the exorbitant cost."
7033,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Food took FOREVER and we were starving.
7034,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Real veterans of HHAGG will know that and be prepared for the wait.
7035,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,We couldnt wait to leave the place and it took our server a long time to get the check even though we asked for it like FIVE TIMES!
7036,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Would be good practice to have every table's shakers wiped down between guests, for sure, as the ones we had were kind of yucky."
7037,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Not worth the money or the wait in line.
7038,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,the place seems absolutely understaffed and I kept saying one woman in particular running around looking absolutely confused as to what to do about everyone's empty plates.
7039,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I think we waited 30-40 mins to receive our food.
7040,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Then, the server arrived and left us with a tablet to look at the drink menu."
7041,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Be prepared for a long wait unless you stalk people at the bar, which we did and waited less than 5 minutes."
7042,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,We would ask for drinks and he would bring out our drinks 20 minutes later.
7043,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Service was pretty sparse despite the restaurant being barely a quarter full.
7044,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,-At each food station some things were clearly marked as to what it was and others not.
7045,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Service is a bit slow.
7046,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"They were very accurate with the time, an hour had passed so we decided to see how much long, a different hostess greeted me but this one was not to happy."
7047,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I came to Vegas to try all of the ramsey restaurant's, and honesty it was worth the trip and the wait...the line was long!"
7048,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"From the start of getting seated to pile of plates sums up, BAD experience for us."
7049,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"It had like a strong garlic salt taste to it
-The guy at the carving station: was very inattentive."
7050,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,We were choking down the wonderful food because we couldn't get a refill of our drinks.
7051,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,However... note to business owners\/management:  The onsite manager stood there and did nothing (except talk to the servers).
7052,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"For a small party it would be ok.  My entree didn't show up with what I requested, but our server was so busy, I didn't want to bother him."
7053,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"There were MANY empty tables, so not sure why it took so long to get us in."
7054,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,She had to wait to get her food until almost everyone was done eating.
7055,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Unfortunately, they don't take reservations for the patio so be prepared to wait."
7056,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,He want attentive at all and we hardly saw him the whole time we were there even tho the restaurant was nearly empty.
7057,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The service was lackadaisical.
7058,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I also noticed the server offering a special dish to others but she did not say anything to me.
7059,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Brought 3 out of 7 of our drinks and placed them in the wrong place.
7060,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Over all, good flavors, small-ish portions, in-attentive service."
7061,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,for food and spirits and finally walked out leaving a mininal tip after the waiter brought me an after dinner drink that was supposed to be hot....again...only mildly warm...and then I had to wait 15 minutes AFTER I was finished for the check...... ....it is a great location with cold\/lukewarm food and poor service....again...sorry I can't give this the reviews I read....just the truth here...maybe things will change....I felt disappointed.
7062,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I went on a Monday at 3pm, so probably not the most ideal time to see the freshest foods and most attentive staff, but less people to fight with to get to the food
2."
7063,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"It is the best buffet that I have ever had, however it is too pricey and the wait was long."
7064,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The only reason I give this place a 4 is because of the expensive prices & long wait :(
7065,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,This place seems to always have a line...
7066,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Service by the hostess is not good, the place does not smell great, and the food lacks taste."
7067,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,We had to wait an hour to get in and the quality of the food we waited for was terrible.
7068,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I must say the lack of customer service probably went down hill because it was overcrowded.
7069,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Bad food and even worse service.
7070,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"But the real icing on this cake, and the reason for two stars instead of three, was the incredibly lousy service we received from our server, Gabriel."
7071,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"To start we waited in line for approximately 30+min, which is not bad for most restaurants during the dinner hour, but for a burger joint?"
7072,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,This topped it all off and required a complaint to the manager.
7073,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,We had to get up and ask another server in a separate section for more drinks and to have our plates removed.
7074,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,This means majority of the guests are waiting for others to receive their food before everyone gets to enjoy.
7075,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I waited for about 30 minutes (outside at the express counter, not inside the restaurant) for an original frozen hot chocolate."
7076,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"NOT worth the price ($45)

After waiting for an hour and a half, we were very excited to try the food but ended up so disappointed :( 

1st trip around, everything tasted like it was left out for too long or over cooked."
7077,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I don't expect special treatment but I do expect the server to have a brain and realize when kids are at a table that maybe put the kids food in first and keep their drinks coming.
7078,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Definitely not worth going back again for the food and service.
7079,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Terrible terrible service.
7080,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,It was really really crowded and servers do not have time for you at all.
7081,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,That would be the fault of management for allowing this type of service to go on.
7082,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I hate waiting for food.
7083,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"We were a party of 5 on Sunday evening at 6:00pm, although the wait was short, the lines to get the food was ridiculously long."
7084,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Round 2 - seated when pressed with the situation, was that so hard?"
7085,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Unfortunately the service was not very good though.
7086,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Have you ever gotten an attitude or service so bad, it just ruins the whole meal?"
7087,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"They never sent me any kind of invoice when the charge occurred, then when I finally got a hold of someone over the phone that was actually part of Bacchanal management I was told that they were willing to give me a ""discount"" of 3 people for the mysterious 10 people that they wrongfully charged me for."
7088,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The service was super slow at the registers and the manager was right there and didn't think to have another cashier open.
7089,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I dunno I tried the food and for a Vegas Buffet, I dont think I would go here again because it wasn't memorable and the service we had was kinda poor, meat was over cooked, and the deserts were ok, but were of mediocre quality."
7090,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Yes, I know this is a new place and they want to make sure all is going well but it isn't necessary to ask us 4 times if our burgers are okay."
7091,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"She told us we would only have to wait 2 more minutes, which turned out to be 30 more minutes."
7092,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Good food, but overpriced  The wait is long during peak hours, but that is to be expected for most buffets in Vegas."
7093,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,She totally doesn't know what owning up mistakes is.
7094,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"While service always seems to be slower outside, it is good people-watching and just a better experience overall."
7095,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I think I would say that this is the least friendly staff we found at a strip establishment on this trip.
7096,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"That's it, she was really nice-sounds corny, I know but table was ready, she got out of me that it was my bday (passed it to the wait staff...) and 3-4 other fun facts then seated 2 of us at one of those 2 peole tables in the middle of all those kind of places where you feel really uncomfortable, ugh."
7097,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Getting served by more servers than people in your party, having dishes from different tables taken to your table, and having to wait half an hour to be noticed is not what I was expected for a place held in such high regard."
7098,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,One time had to skip though because the line was five times as long as I had ever seen it.
7099,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Let's be quite frank: food service sucks.
7100,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Just very glad Bellagio gained our taste buds' confidence back after the disappointment at Aria's poor impression on not only ""so-called"" interior design, but also very bad service."
7101,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Wait on line too long for burgers.
7102,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Located in a nondescript strip mall and services is so so especially the hostess and the reservations.
7103,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"No no no.... That's not how to react to someone spending their time on the phone complaining instead of having fun, act like you care, and try hard to be nice since you are a major asshole."
7104,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The products are not the same (don't get the BLT Mary at this location, it's a sad attempt at imitating the real one in SD), the vibe is not the same, money put into staffing is not the same."
7105,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,(How come nobody cleaned up this stuff?
7106,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"You wait way to long for mediocre food, if anything just get the frozen hot chocolate otherwise everything else is a waste!"
7107,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The service was very slow.
7108,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"My friends didn't believe me when I said each plate is the size of a house, so to prove them wrong we trekked down the strip to the LINQ hotel and we were met with a crowded restaurant and a 45 minute wait for a party of four."
7109,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,This is where I feel like the employees did more chatting than working efficiently.
7110,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The problem was the service...or lack thereof.
7111,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The service sucked and the employees were rude, not professional."
7112,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The buffet at Bellagio had the selection but lacked flavors in most dishes, the lighting was dark and gloomy, the ambiance was dated, and the service...omg the service was horrible."
7113,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,It's so busy that the service isn't great either.
7114,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,There is also a location off the strip that is just as great and sometimes the wait isn't as long.
7115,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I did bring this issue up with the staff there and they all agreed that the setup is bad, but they can't really do anything about it."
7116,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I wanted to really like this place... but it's way too touristy , too crowded and at not fault of the servers because of the crowds the overall service is lacking."
7117,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The Host was not nice about it and informed me that ""they need to get here"" if I wanted to keep the spot."
7118,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,We were then seated at the worst table possible and we asked if we could possibly be reseated in a booth or somewhere in a more comfortable spot (we got the spot right in front of the kitchen door).
7119,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"However, being completely ignored by the employees and having to wait outside in the cold for a $12 drink that I'm quite certain I could have made just as well at home is NOT my idea of a hit out of the park."
7120,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,All I am saying is don't be fooled by long lines and a full restaurant because it is a lie.
7121,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"By the time we had finished our meal, there was a 40 minute wait for 2-tops."
7122,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Some fav's over Thanksgiving weekend:
- Butternut squash risotto
- pumpkin ravioli
- Oysters Rockefeller
- crab legs
- pumpkin pie


The crepe line was way too long, as was the wait too be seated, but otherwise, this place is still tops on my L.V."
7123,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"It's a long line and not worth the wait, I'd rather go down the road to In and Out... 
At least there I know everything is Cooked to Order!"
7124,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"He asked me what choice of meat I wanted I told him and then he didn't repeat back what I wanted so I repeated it a second time to remind him and he then copped an attitude and said "" I Heard you man you don't got to tell me twice"" and I was like woah, this guy is pissed."
7125,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Then we were finally escorted to our table and were waited on by a waiter who seem very nonchalant and uninterested in serving us.
7126,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"(great way to make people line up outside to get you hyped it and make the restaurant look good)

- our waiter was beyond horrible."
7127,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"When we approached them after about 10 minutes to let them know we thought the buzzer may be malfunctioning, they did not listen and dismissed us, telling us to wait until we were called."
7128,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Service was also poor for making dish customizations for vegetarians.
7129,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Don't let the long line fool you.
7130,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"You look around and everyone has the same sad face of ""Where is my food?????"""
7131,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I've been wanting to try this place....so we gave it a try while I was in Vegas this time.I was disappointed with the service.
7132,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I think we had to wait for about an hour and a half.
7133,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Terrible service.
7134,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,This is technically a review update as I was originally working on a 2-star review for this restaurant (had dinner with friends during a bachelorette party and it was TERRIBLE for both food and service).
7135,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The cost of this buffet is not the cheapest and there is always a wait so be prepared for that.
7136,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The line which was 20+ people deep all grumbled in disbelief, I personally understand that you have to close a some point but certainly not before closing time & not without cutting off the line- this was just bad customer service plain & simple."
7137,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,My first visit wasn't that great because I thought I got the scraps of lunch because they were closing for dinner soon.
7138,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"However, the food quality itself and customer service still have lots areas that needs to be improved."
7139,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"You look for your own seating, and clean up after yourself."
7140,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The service was great and staff were frienfly, not stuffy."
7141,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I did not complain about them not taking the meal off my bill because I am on vacation and did not want to bother with arguing the fact that a hair in my food is disgusting, but I definitely will not be returning here!"
7142,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Service was a bit slow but the food was amazing and worth the wait.
7143,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"So, in short, I definitely recommend this place as long as you don't mind the wait or price."
7144,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"45 min wait for Thai food , little much."
7145,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"That and maybe a couple more drinks...

Now while waiting in line to gain entry into the promised land, I did what every bored fat kid does when waiting in line at a buffet."
7146,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"For my 15% tip of a $90 meal, the service was lacking."
7147,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"All in all, Hash House was good but a bit over-hyped, over-priced, and probably not worth the wait next time we visit."
7148,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I admited that it was my fault to change my side order but as a waitress, you should not let your customer see your attitute, missy."
7149,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Her explanation for stopping our endless bottomless drinks was I have been drinking for 2 hours already.
7150,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,This restaurant was awesome it was totally worth the wait and the walking.
7151,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The waitress nor bar tenders had not asked me about my food(only dropped it off and then no questions).
7152,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"It sucks that they have such an awesome location and awesome theme, but the service just ruins it all."
7153,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"After a 45 minute wait, we ordered our food immediately because my husband had a poker tournament to make."
7154,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"During Vegas' busy seasons, you might find yourself waiting 30+ mins to get a table depending on how big your party is."
7155,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Just don't appreciate the service they provide, and the food too, isn't as good as it used to be."
7156,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,it's better than many other options if you don't end up being in the line for hours.
7157,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,So because Caesar's Palace  FAILS MISERABLY at having a better system in place for reservations and moving their buffet line...
7158,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Not a fan of the workers.
7159,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"As some of the reviews state, yes there is definitely a wait, and yes, the cashiers are definitely not the most pleasant people... but overall, I thought this buffet was well worth the $40."
7160,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I have eaten there three times and faced the same problem... great food but difficult to get to it.
7161,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,after 25 minutes I had to walk around and ask 4 different servers if we could just please have some water because my 4 year old daughter had something spicy and was crying.
7162,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"we were there at 2nd of Dec, After reception brought us to the table, we waited 8 minutes to have someone came to serve us."
7163,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Unfortunately I found the service to be sub par and the workers unfriendly.
7164,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Turns out, she got my order wrong and brought me the cocktail listed right above the Paris Romance."
7165,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Make sure you get there early enough to avoid the lines!
7166,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The line moved quickly, although I did find it a bit frustrating that parties with 4+ people had their own special line that moved much quicker than the line for smaller parties."
7167,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"My last gripe is it took 20 minutes to get our check, this was after they cleared our table."
7168,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Horrible customer service that talks down to you and even worse management.
7169,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I had to ask for another, at the risk of spoiling our appetites, because the kids had waited a while."
7170,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"We were honest in our opinions, giving the service a C- and the food an A."
7171,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Finally as a last ditch attempt, I literally got up and found yet another employee to ask, again a server (no manager in sight)."
7172,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The staff wasn't really friendly either, and at $65 dollars a person I really expected a better experience."
7173,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The service was also quite disappointing.
7174,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Not much customer service either,."
7175,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Anyways, after all the rude remarks and attitude he gave us while ordering, our food finally came out."
7176,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The only gripe I had about my visit was that a random table server accidentally spilled water on my shoulder.
7177,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The line for the Wynn buffet was super long at around 10:40 am when we got there.
7178,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"It is world famous people came here, television networks came here, I gave it a 4 only because, with a group they split the check in 2 per check, no individual, the lunch portions are too small."
7179,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"We had chosen a bottle of wine and an appetizer for the table, but she refused to take the appetizer request until she went and got the wine!"
7180,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,There was a 30-40 minute wait for the patio but no line to dine inside.
7181,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Service was good even though it was very busy.
7182,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Our table was in a service dead zone.
7183,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I've probably walked by this place a dozen times, and always thought about trying out the food, but generally got dissuaded by the super long lines during the spring, summer and fall."
7184,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I get they're busy, but they have this service if you pay extra they seat you right away which is fine but there is no special line for it and when you've been waiting over an hour it's annoying."
7185,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I was annoyed by the fact that the hostess was not taking names in the order that we had lined up.
7186,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Although it is a super cute place, they made us wait at least an hour."
7187,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"No thanks, there are lots of places on the Vegas strip, less money for better services."
7188,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The service was terrible as well so not a fan....This is the first time ever I had to send both orders back - will not return - they all seemed shocked I did not like there terrible food.
7189,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I know it got busy while we were there and maybe she had a few too many tables to wait on but it took forever to get her to come back to the table and also took forever for her to give us our bill.
7190,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Bacchanal, utilize more servers per section."
7191,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Bus boys would stand around not removing our finished plates.
7192,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The service lacks alittle but the food is well worth waiting for.
7193,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Unfortunately our service was terrible once the waitress realized we weren't there to eat and pretty much put us in the back burner.
7194,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Not a fan of the the wait time for a table or to get the food, though so don't show up too hungry."
7195,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"However, until further improvements have been made on service and food, I do not recommend nor I will go back to this buffet for the price and the ""Super luxury"" buffet that they claimed themselve to be."
7196,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Or you could go to M Resort's buffet, not wait in the long line and not spend $70pp!"
7197,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Then to top it all off a girl who probably drank too much at the champagne brunch earlier vomited on the chairs and table on her way to the bathroom near our table and it took too long to get it all cleaned up and they didn't even apologize to us or offer to move us to a different table.
7198,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,we were so hungry & the server was apologetic enough to convince me to wait.
7199,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Usually these sort of restaurants in Vegas have great service, service that makes you forget about having to wait for your food."
7200,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The service was below average.
7201,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Okay, I would have gave this place 5 stars, if it wasn't for the hour wait... which I still don't understand because when we finally got inside, there were bunch of free tables!"
7202,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Would have wrote the incident off as me being over-sensitive and host being ""out to lunch"", but then he looked up and ignored us, continuing a casual conversation with the girl at the front counter as we left."
7203,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"However, they seem to present a challenge to the staff in keeping the plating process moving as throughout the entire meal we spent more time standing there waiting on an item or skipping it entirely because we could not get it than we ever have before."
7204,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Bad service as my plate was never taken out and my table has 2 stacked plates as I was walking with a new plate of crab legs that I had gotten from waiting 30 minutes in that separate line.
7205,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,They should be on top of their buffet no matter what time they close.
7206,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,They have a Mac and Cheese bar that is apparently made to order but when we went there was no staff there to help so we didn't get to try it.
7207,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Red curry was,definitely my favorite had to wait roughly 30 minutes for a table no big deal the food was worth it kind of a formal setting feel to things was quite packed"
7208,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,This is the most unfriendly and unprofessional environment!
7209,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The line was also crazy long, and the service a bit less than Vegas-best."
7210,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"We thought we'd grow old and die before being seated, so we checked out their other options: 1) the to-go line outside of the restaurant and 2) order to-go at the bar."
7211,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The service wasn't that great.
7212,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Such a restaurant in one of the best hotels in Las Vegas, I would expect the better service or, at least, have the professionalism from cooks and chefs behind of the food table area."
7213,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,They need to improve their service.
7214,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"To save a little time, we opted to sit outside in the 110 degree Vegas weather on their little patio area."
7215,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,What ruins the food though is the horrible service.
7216,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Customer service the first time we went (breakfast around 11am) sucked.
7217,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"bread, pasta, rissoto bar)

The wait was a good hour 15, but that was expected especially when we were arriving at 6ish."
7218,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Some fantastically original offerings...some standard Ponderosa\/OCB offerings...mainly mouthwatering, and more less worth the $53 check and 45 minute wait."
7219,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I got messages from buffet around 4:30 to come back and wait around 1 hr.
7220,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Avoid this place.. (I know I know it's pink it's cute but not worth it) 

- the employees all look like they are tired of their lives and everyone else!"
7221,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The lowlight of the MAG dining experience was when the server pretty much threw the creme brûlée on the table.
7222,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"When I requested to be reseated, the management promised me that they'd move us as soon as 5 more seats became available, yet we watched as walk-ups were continually seated instead."
7223,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Had to even put our order in with another server which took over 20 mins to show up and it was just a sundae.
7224,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I definitely noticed a downgrade of food offerings, diminshing food quality, and overall service was lacking."
7225,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I always saw Gordon get angry about service time on TV, so I had to take a little off for that flaw."
7226,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"While the number of 2-top tables is the vast majority of the restaurant, the number of couples far exceeds this which can lead to half hour to hour waits."
7227,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,What I've learned about watching Gordon Ramsay's shows is to be diligent and not to make your customers wait forever for their food.
7228,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"First off there was a decently long wait for just my husband and I, granted it was Valentine's day during the prime dinner time rush, but still with no where to sit down and a bunch of hosts that didn't even try to present a friendly demeanor, I'm counting that as strike 1."
7229,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,It was very busy so the service was a bit messy.
7230,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,We couldn't even bring our issues to their attention since everyone was just standing by the pos machines talking to each other.
7231,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The Wicked Spoon doesn't have self service drinks (aside from a juice in the buffet area) so waiting through an entire plate just to be greeted for a drink, let alone RECEIVING it well into our second plates was more than disappointing."
7232,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I think after bringing these items to the servers' attention, something should have been done."
7233,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The waitress said it was because the area in the greenhouse area we were in was the ""wind tunnel"" but it was still disappointing."
7234,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Would've been a 4 stars if their service was better!
7235,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,We left he buffet after an hour or so without any water or drinks.
7236,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Then trying to get seated with dozens of empty tables took 15 min of waiting for 5 staff members ambling around like mindless zombies to finally decide to seat people.
7237,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The management was indifferent and didn't care.
7238,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Wait is a bit long, but you can always take turns with your friends and gamble while you wait :) the meat selections are heavenly and never disappoints"
7239,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,In the end we were not only annoyed but disappointed with the level of service.
7240,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,After waiting in a line as long as the Space Mountain queue my friend and I were finally seated at the high tables (because waiting for a real table would have taken even more time).
7241,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I came around 9:30 PM and waited about 25 minutes for a table.
7242,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Then you wander around the area for approximately 40 minutes until you receive a text message or the time on your ticket is up so you then return to the buffet line and hand the worker your ticket, to wait in line for about 30 minutes."
7243,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"However, just before our food was delivered, the waiter told me that the chef made the mistake of making a pecan pumpkin pancake on my order instead."
7244,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Especially this one guy called Kareem: he is too moody for a waiter at a French restaurant.
7245,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,We stood in line for over an hour to find a sub par buffet.
7246,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"We asked for suggestions since we said we don't eat pork and all she said was "" well if you don't order right now, your food is going to take 30-35 mins to be ready"" and left."
7247,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"CONS (way less cons than pros, so let's start here):
- there is always a line."
7248,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Customer service lacked immensly.
7249,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I agree with other posters that we hardly get our plates removed.
7250,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,We were almost through our first plate of food and we had to stare down a waiter to bring us something to drink.
7251,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Hey Server - tall, skinny blond woman - if you recently got less than your expected tip, evaluate how serve customers and try to act like you have an ounce of courtesy to all your tables and not a select one."
7252,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"With a party of 4 people, I'm surprised our server didn't advise us that there would only be two."
7253,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Instead... they were happily giggling and chatting in a corner with a few of the waitstaff.
7254,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"That's the way to go  

And if you find yourself not wanting to wait in line for that long you can walk to the buffet at the Bellagio, which nowadays has a shorter queue (and serves beef Wellington which bacchanal unfortunately lacks)"
7255,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Down's
They told us 45 minute wait which turned into a two hour wait."
7256,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"*Service does slow down when it gets crowded, so if you want refills or another fork\/spoon you need to flag them down."
7257,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Here's the quick low-down of this place:
- the sheer variety of food is dizzying so come hungry
- the food is top notch so don't feel bad if you can't get to every type of cuisine (think quality vs. quantity)
- arrive early for dinner since long lines are common place
- arrive early with another dash of early dinner since it is a walk from the entrance of the hotel (this place is kind of hidden towards the back of The Cosmopolitan)

The Wicked Spoon is a good ending to a long day of walking the strip."
7258,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Unprofessional management, there are a lot of table empty but no one clean it, so there are only 70% can provide to customers."
7259,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,When we  were about to leave we couldn't find our waiter half the time but overall it was still a cute experience.
7260,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"If you are on a budget do yourself a huge favor and go out to eat somewhere more cheaper where they are more attentive and caring about their customers and you will more than likely still have a lot of that money leftover from the $140+ I have spent here .....and ended up hungry anyway....go see a show, go shopping, do anything else ......trust me you will be happier with your choice that throwing it away at this place
- Too much hype 
- Not worth it one bit
- Just regular food
- Bad or non existent customer service"
7261,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"It's supposed to make the place fit the brand, but when your staff isn't a bunch of manikins, it's distracting."
7262,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Food items were also not regularly replenished and when I inquired about the sushi which had run out, the staff did not appear apologetic about that and expressed no interest in replenishing the items."
7263,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Bacchanal is the best, but it comes with a pretty hefty price tag and a usually long wait in line."
7264,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,But those two things in no way justify the price or the wait or the raves this place gets.
7265,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"For one, don't let the long lines deceive you into believing that you're going to be eating some luxury food."
7266,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The lines for the meat options (brisket, rack of lamb, prime rib) and for the seafood (mostly shrimp and crab legs) were really long and interrupted the flow of the other food stands."
7267,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Also, they get so busy that the service is really slow."
7268,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Shared a strawberry sundae with my bf b\/c I know how big the portions are and I think the server was annoyed that we were sitting in his section and only ordering one item, which I get, but we were still going to tip him well."
7269,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,All the Yelp reviews are right; service is horrible.
7270,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,We had to ask twice for a new napkin because the first was stained and dirty and our server brought us the wrong bill first.
7271,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,And the service is horrible.
7272,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Then, our server Jessie didn't really tend to us very much."
7273,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Place was ok, burgers were good it's in Vegas and has a famous chefs name involved so it was packed and there were lines."
7274,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,While we are being shown to our table we notice that there is a HUGE line at the buffet inside the restaurant!
7275,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I gave it 4 stars because of a few things, lack of bbq sauce at rib station, and often running out of desserts."
7276,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Although the entree seemed to take a long time ever though the server mentioned it would be right out.
7277,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,It bothers me a lot and people should take responsibility for the people working beneath them.
7278,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,They don't really interact w\/ you and give off a vibe that they hate their job.
7279,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Overall, we were not impressed with the food and service there."
7280,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"There was a time that I looked for the waiter for 20 minutes, they came around me but IGNORED me."
7281,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Lousy service after paying top dollar leaves a bad taste in the mouth no matter how amazing the food is.
7282,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"She said ""i have to take the vips first"" mind you there were hardly any people walking up on the VIP side, we asked again a few minutes later since the general line was moving and we could already have been closer, she responded ill get my manager."
7283,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Service  was slow.
7284,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,We had empty glasses several times and the waitress had to be told we needed refills.
7285,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Overall the ending of our experience was horrible, lacking in any customer service, and a disservice to the restaurant"
7286,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The service is OK but the menu and the food easily make up for it.
7287,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Overall, great food, but I wish the service wasn't so poor."
7288,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,But the real problem was these young waiters.
7289,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"If you are looking for $200 beef jerky and to be treated like crap upon check in you should make a ""reservation"" for this place."
7290,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Our waiter also forgot The Husband's Kronenbourg, which required a bit of reminding."
7291,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Although the place is casual, men can't wear tank tops or sleeveless shirts."
7292,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The worst part is customer care.
7293,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The waiter was not so friendly neither, and forgot our hors d'oeuvre\/ hor devours."
7294,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"You can tell how popular it is by the long, long lines that this place has."
7295,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Mentioned this to the restaurant manager and she responded by saying ""We have over 1000 people come in each day and you were the only person to get sick, so it's not our food that caused it""."
7296,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"But this place offers AFFORDABLE DELICIOUS french cuisine in the most adorable little French setting and includes a gorgeous shaded patio facing the strip, so You d@mn-well better expect there's gonna be a wait."
7297,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The worst thing was that he told me when our food came, so it wasn't like I had any choice to change my order."
7298,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Wait was a bit long 35min and once sat down a lot of empty tables were available which was a bit odd.
7299,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"But if you take turns gambling on the nearby slots while you wait, it's not so bad."
7300,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Finally I saw another waiter and asked him and he brought one..booo.
7301,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"All we wanted was an apology from him & it would have been fine, but apparently customer service isn't his strong point."
7302,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,service is pretty slow and the food is just ok. the emphasis seems to be on volume over quality.
7303,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Why should I reward terrible service .
7304,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"[THE INTERIOR]: Before you enter the buffet, you will see a huge line, that will remind you of Disneyland."
7305,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"My husband and I didn't understand some of things that were said to us until we gave it a few minutes of thoughtful consideration after the fact.... 

""Ohhhh, he said CARROT salad.. Oh okay."
7306,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"It is, of course, overpriced and hardly worth the wait, but if you want quality and choices like this in Vegas you have to either pay for it or have the patience of a very bored saint to stand in line."
7307,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The wait time on a weekday evening was about 50 mins which goes by surprisingly fast while waiting at a casino.
7308,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Dinner experience = amazing and the food definitely made up for the service in the beginning.
7309,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,We waited much longer for food than other tables around us but it was worth the wait.
7310,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"There is often a long line of people trying to drown their sorrows of losing their last hand of poker in infinite food (just kidding, not really), so be prepared to budget about 30-45 minutes of wait time."
7311,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Especially since the staff at most of these buffets seem to be a slight notch above TSA\/Airport security in regards to service.
7312,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,People were waiting to some dishes to be refilled and the staff who were manning the areas where less than enthusiastic towards the waiting dinners.
7313,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Maybe she was having a bad day, but deal it with lady, you're in the service industry!!"
7314,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,We asked him 3 times for another glass of water but he just kept on refilling the one glass we had on the table.
7315,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,They need to find a better method for serving the most demanded item in their buffet.
7316,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Go here for the experience but don't expect for great food and service.
7317,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Also, to the lady at the cashier: if you aren't keen in helping the customer, then please quit your job and not work In any service industry."
7318,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Took us 20 mins to get in because they had two cashiers.. One catering the Gold members so basically one cashier.
7319,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"However, even questionable service still doesn't compare to the impeccable food."
7320,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The hostess in the front were kind of rude, but if the food is good then whatever."
7321,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The lady in the front seem to be angry that more people were coming in at 8:45.
7322,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Given a ridiculous line, I would expect the food is awesome."
7323,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"YOU WILL RECIEVED A TEXT WITHIN 1 hour (MAYBE slightly more).. once you recieved the text, MAKE SURE YOUR ENTIRE PARTY IS WITH YOU because 
""""you cannot have ONE PERSON stay in line while your entire party\/family is out gambling."""""
7324,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"They did have a cute little peking duck bun station that was nice, although the server was never around."
7325,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,But anyhow aside from that service was great and the shakes even better.
7326,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The service not so much.
7327,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I hope the food makes up for the terrible service from the hostesses.
7328,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"After tasting the food I had waited so long for, and paid so much for (It was an Easter buffet or something at the time), I was really not blown away."
7329,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"service was bad... waiter dissappeared and changed to another one without telling us 
food was delicious though... lots of meat cuts, king crabs... etcs
only good dessert that MUST have is creme burlee!!!!"
7330,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,He even discouraged us from ordering the Thai salad because he said the dressing might have been made with it as well.
7331,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Uber slow service.....like incredibly, mind-numbingly SLOW."
7332,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The sundae was good, but it definitely doesn't make up for the horrendous service."
7333,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The restaurant was packed!
7334,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The comments about the service are spot on, whoever is running this place obviously doesn't know the meaning of customer service, or just doesn't care that the service is rude, unfriendly, and completely uncaring about the customer's experience."
7335,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Slippery food + smooth tongs = disaster.
7336,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I had other las vegas buffet for third of the price that was much better..... and no 40 minute wait in line.
7337,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Even though the initial wait was long and our server wasn't the best (for quite some time we didn't even know who our server was), it doesn't ruin the quality of service we received from everyone else or the quality of food!"
7338,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"CONS: Service was very spotty with certain requests we made with the server, bacon was underwhelming, apple crepes were too sweet"
7339,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"In the event that any upper management would like to educate this particular person on the proper treatment of his staff, I would identify him as a thin, taller man in his mid fifties, working on Wednesday, September 4th around 10:30 am."
7340,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,We were seated right when we got there which was great but the service and catering to me due to it being my birthday was not up to par .
7341,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,My experience was soured by our first interaction with the management staff.
7342,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,":)

Cons:  The lines are almost always super long."
7343,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,the service was ok. our waitress wasn't very attentive at all.
7344,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The lines were super long for the seafood section.
7345,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Quite obvious that the training must have stressed customer service ... and it is working.
7346,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Service fell off after we received our food and no follow up was made until the check was brought to us.
7347,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The outside of the restaurant looks like a hole-in-the-wall type of place located in a shady\/seedy looking strip mall but once you walk inside be prepared for a long wait if you don't already have reservations.
7348,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,There seems to be a lack of concern for seating the patrons as quickly as possible.
7349,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"excessive amounts instead of quality

tough choice, food was a little bit better than average, the overall service was way less than standard and the atmosphere was not good."
7350,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"- Sweet Potato Fries: Yummy and sweet but by the time I had been through the lines and got to eat it, it was cold ):
- Mac and Cheese: Why would I get mac n cheese at a 45-dollar buffet?"
7351,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I then witnessed one of the other servers ""mean mug"" my friend as she walked past the table twice, roll her eyes and shake her head."
7352,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,It took way to long to be waited on and served.
7353,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Only downside to the restaurant is that if you get here slightly late, you might end up waiting a very very long line for an available table, so it's advised to eat early and take your time to enjoy the food and the street view (if you decide to eat outside)."
7354,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I called the Bellagio and told them what was going on to which they said they can only report it and do nothing else.
7355,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Beware - there are no reservations for patio seating so if you want a view plan to head over early and wait.
7356,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,despite the long line and wait for the food.. my family and i still enjoyed our meal here.
7357,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"do the to-go line outside, but I won't lie, you will probably find yourself waiting\/spending the same time outside as you would have to be seated and served indoors."
7358,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Our food arrived at our table 58 minutes after we were seated.
7359,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"But I don't come to buffets for the service, I come for the food."
7360,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"It was every bit of forty five minutes before our food came and guess what it took another twenty minute for my Hash Cobb salad to arrive, by that time I didn't want the salad I want to go our waiter never came over or nothing until I sent back the late salad."
7361,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Doesn't matter how good the food is, when service is that bad from someone because we have two groups of 5, nothing will make up for it."
7362,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Seconds later as I headed back to my table, a staff member had picked it up, shoved it in my face, and scoffed at me as if I was less than dirt for dropping a little tomato on their floor."
7363,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,It could have to do with the stress of having to tell people there are long wait times but it really does make a difference.
7364,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The wait for food was longer than expected.
7365,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"worst place ever... don't ever go.... we decided to take a chance and go in .... looked like a fun place to have breakfast\/lunch.... never again... the wait was for 90 minutes even though they said 30 minutes and omg one of the girls in the front needs to get hired.. worst serve ever... she was very rude and people would walk up to her to ask a question and she would just ignore them....

after all that wait the food wasnt even good... just a freaken waste of time... dont waste your time by going in"
7366,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,We complained to the manager about the mistreatment and lack of professionalism and the manager was disinterested in what we had to say and blandly offered to bring over a glass of champagne.
7367,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I was extremely unhappy with the tone of the lady at the cashier, and I was not the only one."
7368,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Barely an apology for making me so uncomfortable after spending a ton of money at their restaurant.
7369,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Fairly good thai food but they don't really take reservations (they take phone reservations but its impossible to get through) and a lot of people came and left disappointed when we were waiting.
7370,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,It just sucks cause the service has declined over the years.
7371,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,It took another 30-40 mins to get our food in which we gave our credit card then and there but they took about another HOUR when everyone but my hubs had to leave for him to give us the credit statement!
7372,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"But wow...I thought customer service was an important thing to a place that claims to give its customer's ""AN EPIC EXPERIENCE"" but this was quite far from it."
7373,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"He tried really hard to get me to take 3 tacos, but I looked him in the eye and he finally gave me one."
7374,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Staff seems burnt out.
7375,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,He then explained the menu but I was still confused if frys came with the burgers or not.
7376,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"And although I don't mind, our servers were not as personal as other comparable buffets."
7377,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Look, I grew up in this business including high-end, low-end and buffets: If you reseat my damn table when I am at the buffet line, YOU have the manager come over and apologize."
7378,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The attendant (Fernando) was rather unprofessional with him throwing his arms in all direction and serving very unpleasantly.
7379,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,After we politely complained we were told if we wanted to sit together we needed to pay an automatic 18% gratuity to sit in a room that would accommodate us.
7380,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Poor service and he food was just ok.
7381,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,It makes no sense to line up to get into the buffet and line up again to get your food.
7382,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Again, expect for a long wait on your food and long wait in line...unless you're the God\/Goddess of Total Rewards points and they will just let you bypass the line."
7383,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"So when you spend $86.00 on a buffet for two, don't expect a smile, because your not getting one!"
7384,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The service was disorganized, the place was ridiculously loud and thank goodness we had reservations or I would have gone bananas."
7385,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"As for the food, I'm sure there is a higher turn-over of the buffet items on weekends when the restaurant is seated at full capacity."
7386,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I wasn't a fan of the fact that reservations, and walk ups were in the same line, but whatever."
7387,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I can't believe it took me this long to eat at Earl of Sandwich, there's one like 5 mins away from me by Disneyland but never went to it until now."
7388,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"We finally got our seats at around 1 pm, the wait was pretty long outside, what we didn't know was the wait for the food was even longer!!"
7389,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Did I mention the service was so slow???
7390,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"-very incompetent and unprofessional staff to deal with waiting crowd, which should be a badge of honor to any establishment."
7391,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Worst customer service Ever.
7392,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"i felt for this amount of money, the hype, the length of time, the mediocre service, and the quality of food, and lack of options- they deserve only one star."
7393,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"If people are wiping out your food, why not just replace it with piping hot new food right away?"
7394,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The issue is that we had to wait for our food for thirty minutes and it was difficult to flag down our server, even though he was constantly walking around our area."
7395,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The waitress I had was 90 years old with dementia.
7396,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The lines are always long.
7397,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,But is Bachannal willing to risk their 10 out of 10 rating for slacking in customer service and urgency?
7398,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"None of the dishes were cleared off the table and everything was overflowing, and they didn't get us any refills or anything."
7399,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The plates see dirty and I will nut drink the water.
7400,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I have never encountered a more miserable waiter in my life.
7401,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"A two hour wait from putting in our name, to finally receiving our food."
7402,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Their customer service was not the best though.
7403,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I would like to point out that while it was busy when we got there, it had definitely died down in our waiters section."
7404,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,If you had questions about the food you would have to talk to your server that brought you drinks because no one was ever close enough behind it to ask them.
7405,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Great quality buffet food with extremely bad service
7406,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Once we settled down and sat at the table for several minutes deciding if we wanted to stay, we thought getting a refund would cause more hassle so we decided to just hit the buffet and try to put the terrible service behind us."
7407,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The service, however, is horrible!"
7408,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"This place is always so packed, the service lacks."
7409,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The hostesses seemed to have an attitude and took forever to arrange our table in a completely empty restaurant and our server took forever and just seemed to be going with the motions.
7410,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"If we wanted to be the center of attendtion then I would have given a 5 star rating, but other table waiter overload with apologies for a hamburger --- it wasn't stake."
7411,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,This place has a horrible customer service also false advertising from a website.
7412,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Our plates were barely getting taken away - the food selection is okay.
7413,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Be prepared to not have a place to sit if you come during a rush.
7414,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I asked the server about the portion size of not only this dish, but the rest of them as well and he replied that they all appeared to be fine."
7415,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"They had run out of a lot of my other favorites as well and even for the items that were left, there was a line."
7416,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,So this place has a pretty long wait especially on weekends.
7417,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Water never refilled until almost to the end of our meal.
7418,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Note: I've been here before for Thanksgiving dinner and the wait was a nightmare (close to 2 hours?).
7419,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"It was your typical vegas day, 110 degrees and hot, we wanted to grab a table and enjoy some frozen beverages but the wait for a table on Saturday afternoon was already 30 minutes."
7420,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Finely she handed us a rag without saying anything.
7421,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The servers were all very nice and friendly.
7422,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Overall, food is average but you could experience hostile attitude.."
7423,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,We didn't receive napkins and our server took forever to take our drink order.
7424,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,We ordered our food and it didn't come out for another 45 MINUTES!!!
7425,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The Buffet begins with a ridiculously long waiting line, which until now, I don't understand the hype behind it."
7426,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"My advice is, ask the waiter how big your order is."
7427,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I asked to speak to the manager and she offered to take 20% off the bill AFTER I had to ask for it some sort of rectification.
7428,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,When you playing close to $80 for two people this service level is unaccetable.
7429,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I would have rated higher if the service was on pointe.
7430,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"She came back and had put the entire bill on 1 card, what?"
7431,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I'm so disappointed with the complete lack of customer service that I don't want to patronize Caesar's again--for ANY of their buffets.
7432,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The waiter tried to get me to order it with beef, but that seemed weird so I said chicken."
7433,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,And the wait inside for certain foods is pretty time-consuming too.
7434,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Given the price, and the average 30 minutes of wait just for food to arrive, I would NOT recommend this place."
7435,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Between appetizers and our main course our waitress did not clear the table and I started to place our dishes on the table next to us to make room.
7436,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The reception desk is usually not very friendly (something they should really work on), but everything else about this place makes up for the arrogance of stressed out 20-something divas."
7437,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The Earl gets 1 damn star because the lady told me very frankly that they can close at any time and do not have to stay open for any reason.
7438,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Finally, they couldn't even manage to get the dishes out together for a party of two."
7439,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,even service is worst among all Vegas buffets.
7440,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Unfortunately, service here was just okay."
7441,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Then within 10 minutes of the  text they cancelled my place in the line.
7442,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"This is definitely the best burger place I've been to so far food-wise, but be warned: don't come here when you're starving because the wait (both for a table and then for the actual food to come) will probably make you faint."
7443,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"If there were waitresses in Star Trek, they would look like the ones here."
7444,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"However, the part that puzzled me was half of the tables were empty."
7445,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I am really disappointed in their service and execution of help during an illness and emergency.
7446,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"If you don't want to deal with a horrible wait, ARRIVE RIGHT WHEN THEY OPEN for lunch \/ dinner!"
7447,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"After spending $270.00
for our buffet dinner, I had hoped for someone to just give me the time
of day."
7448,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Seriously, a ""manager"" addresses his customers with the word ""dude?"""
7449,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Food was 10\/10 but there was a minor blunder in service.
7450,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,It taught me a lesson to always review the bill closely and also make sure the credit card handed back to me is in fact mine.
7451,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Came here at 8pm on Saturday night and the line was still kind of long (it looked like a one hour wait).
7452,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"If I wanted seafood I had to wait in the long meat line in order to grab seafood :\/
That area really needs work with having a better setup for lines."
7453,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Took 15 min to get water, 15 minutes to pay, waitress dropped a glass of water on the table and in my lap."
7454,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The food took awhile to get out but we were warned about that when we were seated because of how busy it was.
7455,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The inly thing is that it took them 40 minutes to seat us and 40 minutes to bring us our food.
7456,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"But because the food is so good, you get past the complete lack of service... not sure why their are a few haters out there but I am fairly well traveled and found the food to be pretty exceptional, particularly for the price.... the only thing we did not love were the desserts... not very good...

...but the rest of the buffet items, both breakfast and dinner, where fantastic!"
7457,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The ""text"" that they were supposed to send to notify us of when we were supposed to be at the restaurant did not arrive and was a complete waste of time."
7458,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I came here with my dad and boyfriend yesterday and one of the buffet servers made a disparaging, unprovoked comment about my dad's race to his face."
7459,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"About the wait, it did take awhile to get seated and the food was a little slow."
7460,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Now the only thing keeping me from giving  this place a 100%  positive review was the wait time on the food.
7461,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,They then took it off the menu but didn't comp our meal at all.
7462,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Very poor service, when the food was finally served it came complete with a strangers hair."
7463,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Once you get passed the long line to the register I normally order 6 sandwiches because I go to Vegas twice a year and the line is long so I have to make it worth my while and share it with the family.
7464,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The hostess was rude and was sure to finish her conversation with her friend before waiting on us.
7465,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Service was a little on the slow side, when it came to keeping up with removing the empty\/used plates at the table, but it really is a HUGE place, so not horribly disappointed in that."
7466,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"My only complaints are the following:

1) The line can be over 90 mins long, which is a little ridiculous for a buffet."
7467,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"This is my favorite spot in the strip, too bad they keep messing up on food 3 several time in a row."
7468,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Service was not speedy but didn't deter a great time.
7469,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"During my first visit the staff could have been friendlier, but never had that same problem any of the other times I went."
7470,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The only disappointments were the wait to get in - over an hour (yes, it was soooo long), the table next to us got way more drink service and attention than we did, and although the desserts are extremely pretty, nothing really stood out as having amazing flavor and as something I'd go back for a second time."
7471,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The staff argued that it was in fact well done, we were already miffed about the shake so we didn't argue, just vowed to write this review and never come to this place again."
7472,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The manager Melissa  chose not to focus on customer service.
7473,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I was a little disappointed with the service we received.
7474,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"(Little trick to cut down the wait time is to send one person to wait in line to buy the brunch ticket while another person waits in the line to get seated) 

I will come back next time I'm in Vegas!"
7475,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Staff wasn't too friendly either.
7476,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The fries did come out but before our water was served.. We went for the regular fries and were very disappointed.
7477,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,But No one at the cashier told us it was going to close or the food was going to be taken away soon.
7478,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"), spicy fish (breaded & fried fish fillet), soup dumplings
-Grill: lamb chops were well seasoned and tender; sliders used what tasted to be freshly ground beef; rib eye was a little dry
-Seafood: I didn't get any, but there sure was a long line for the oysters and crab legs
-Dessert: ice cream mochis (limit 2 per trip?!?"
7479,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,They make their meals fresh and from scratch so it took another 25 minutes until we got our food.
7480,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Our original waitress disappeared for awhile after serving us initially before I spotted her standing around doing nothing in another section.
7481,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Bland, processed foods.... Cafeteria like atmosphere with poor service."
7482,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Asked for a menu to look at while we wait and again he seemed bothered.
7483,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,It would be a 3 star restaurant if not for the insanely long wait
7484,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Sarah Jane, one of the top reviewers of this restaurant is even a good friend of mine and because of her relationship with Yelp, she got right in and never had to wait for the gruelingly long line to eat here."
7485,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Finally our order has been taken, drinks are flowing and we wait an hour for our food!"
7486,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"It's probably because I'm so in love with the movie Serendipity... :-) 

The wait for Serendipity is always very long, but it's less ridiculous if you agree to sit outside."
7487,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I'd suggest coming 1-2 hours before you think your stomach will start growling.
7488,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,One negative about the service is the hostesses.
7489,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Please improve your service and bring the quality of the food back up!
7490,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Our 3rd server had to come and let us know that they are behind (even though we came in at 11pm).
7491,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The waitresses and chefs behind the bar were not happy to be there, and the mood in the restaurant seemed more like a fast food setting; get in and get out."
7492,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"What topped off this dismal buffet was our dismal server, not one soda refill and he was nowhere in sight all evening."
7493,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,After another 10 minutes I again asked the food bar lady if I could get the certificate.
7494,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"He came back with some plates and puts them in the middle of the table, I asked why the plates everyone already had there food?"
7495,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"It took them about 5 minutes to take our drink orders, which is always disappointing (especially when you're at a celebrity chef's restaurant; they always rant on their shows about good service)."
7496,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The service was AWFUL and the food was a letdown.
7497,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Still utterly confused, we asked around only to understand that the ticket was not a pass to be seated earlier, but just a piece of paper to show that we were eligible to get in, meaning that we still needed to wait in line to be seated."
7498,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,what kind of service is that!!!
7499,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Food: --\/5
Service: -3\/5 (Yes, NEGATIVE 3 out of +5)
Atmosphere: 4\/5 (looked like a beautiful place to have brunch from the entrance)

This is a review of the time I spent outside of the buffet."
7500,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The cashier line is used to control flow because after paying, you then have to wait in yet another line to be seated."
7501,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The service there can get a little slow, especially in really, really busy times (but since they're always really, really busy, this is pretty much a constant) and on last year's birthday trip, we waited 45 minutes for food without any sort of acknowledgment from management OR our waiter."
7502,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"All in all, service by MY waitress was horrible."
7503,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"""you expect me to PAY for this after the way I was treated?!"""
7504,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"And they just genuinely seem like they don't want to be there which tells me either that they're either hiring the wrong people, or management is not training them well, or creating a good work environment."
7505,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I have never ran into such bad service.
7506,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"In my opinion the food was good, the venue was excellent, and the service was below par."
7507,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Food runs out and people line up for a long time to get in and find fewer food selections.
7508,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The food was amazing, but the timing and service of our meal were executed poorly."
7509,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,In neither instance did we have great service.
7510,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The frozen hot chocolate was delicious, but the service was kind of slow and not really attentive."
7511,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The waitress were not too friendly.
7512,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The service at this establishment is absolutely horrible.
7513,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,We waited about 20 minutes to be seated and about 40 minutes for our food.
7514,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I arrived at the restaurant before my reservation and she didn't mark it on OpenTable, strike 1."
7515,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Only drawback are that it's pretty pricey and the line to get in for brunch was very long.
7516,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,They need to have more staff seating people or a more efficient system!
7517,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"But by the time you have your first bite, you know it's worth the wait."
7518,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I would not come back, considering the wait and the food quality, there's much better food options in Vegas."
7519,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,As I was saying the service was crappy.
7520,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,We were sat very promptly and then our server didn't show up for at least ten minutes while two tables around us were sat and had their different servers show up.
7521,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,That made us feel so much better about the lack of accommodation.
7522,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"As we were in line, the cashiers held up the line and they wanted us to pay for the dinner price."
7523,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Jan 2 at 8pm and was told by the snobbish host that they are not letting anyone in without tickets.
7524,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Regardless, IMO they should have a separate To-Go line or something :P

:: RESTAURANT INTERIOR ::

The interior was pretty big!"
7525,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Plus, the woman making the drinks was also collecting the money and she put her hand on the straw where you put your mouth after touching money."
7526,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Seafood, bbq, Italian, Asian...ect."
7527,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Staff came to clear table and we had to ask for our check.
7528,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Despite that, he did get down our orders pretty quick,but they did take awhile to get unfortunately."
7529,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"But, the service took forever, we waited almost an hour for our food and I felt like our server was kind of food."
7530,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"All I was expecting was an apology or ""I'll go check with the food staff about the supply"" and I would have been ok."
7531,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Then we had asked to speak to the manager and he didn't give a rats ass either.
7532,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,There was already a line of maybe 40 people at around 7pm but being on my own I was able to just wander into the back bar overlooking the kitchen which was a great place to hang out and see the various menu options up close before ordering.
7533,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The service was poor, the coffee was cold, and the food was expensive and not worth the price."
7534,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Aside from the slightly slow service (30 min to get our burgers), Gordon Ramsay's restaurant makes a pretty mean burger."
7535,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"When he told them about the hostess giving out wrong information as a courtesy to them, they were rude and disrespectful."
7536,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Plus when I walked up to the host stand my good was already there with all the proper condiments and necessities like napkins etc.
7537,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Once we were seated out server took his sweet time getting to us.
7538,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Apparently they have no busser in the floor from 7 to  9:30ish at the busiest time.
7539,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Horrible customer service.
7540,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The food was good and the portions are huge, but this was nothing amazing, particularly not worth the 90 minutes we had to wait for a table."
7541,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,No where on the signs or menu did it indicate serving times.
7542,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Me and two other people just walked right up to the counter to pay.
7543,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The only draw back for me is the server seemed a little ""cookie cutter"" and didn't have much of a personality of her own."
7544,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The damn buffet wasn't even half full with empty tables around us and he was worried that we were camping!
7545,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Despite the arm and leg you have to offer to be seated at this establishment, I'd have to say the food is to die for."
7546,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,4 stars for the food minus 1 star for the service.
7547,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Totally impersonal and ridiculous - the one our waiter had took a dump while he was trying to show it to us, and he awkwardly scurried away to get us a new one."
7548,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"It took us about 2.5 hours to get into the buffet with 6 people, but it was worth the wait."
7549,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,None of the other waiters\/waitresses wanted to help out - they all avoided eye contact or ignored my hand waving at them.
7550,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,One of our guest ordered brussels sprouts with his meal and never got it.
7551,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"In summary, novel concept, expensive for what you get, food choices limited compared to other Vegas fine buffets, and fairly long wait time."
7552,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,No takeout until 11AM unless you go to the bar facing he strip.
7553,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"If you're reading this review in the future, hopefully the staff will be more prepared and the food choices will open up just a little by then."
7554,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The only way I think it is remotely worth of going back is if the price is around $25 and there is no wait.
7555,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The only thing that can potentially turn an interested customer away, is the DUMB, ditzy hostesses in the beginning.They're all young, highly insecure and know nothing about working in a restaurant."
7556,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,We ordered unlimited sparkling wine and we were almost done with dinner when we got our first glass.
7557,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Based on the food we had and their inability to even keep the stations stocked, we won't be returning."
7558,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,It took at least 30 minutes for our appetizers and we waited over 40 minutes for our food.
7559,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,very bad customer service!
7560,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The manager finally came over with one plate at 1:05 and apologized for the late meals.
7561,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The service however was bit of a disappointment.
7562,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The server wasn't too attentive to us either since we didn't order food, which was super overpriced as well."
7563,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Perhaps they should consider having some food runners.
7564,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The cheese plate was some $15 and included a tablespoon amount of Bluecheese, Brie, and some herb-laden cheese that I am unfamiliar with (oh btw, these are conclusions I've deduced, the waitress didn't bother to enlighten me to what the ""chef's choice"" actually was)."
7565,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,We got there around 7:15 pm and didn't enter the buffet until 8:30 or so.
7566,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,We were never offered champagne or mimosas as the cashier told us would be offered.
7567,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"We waited in line for 2 hours, and by the time we got to the end of the 2 hour line, we were offered VIP tickets to wait 25 more minutes for around $10-$15 more per person (on top of the hefty $46\/person meal we were already paying) or to wait in line for another 2 hours."
7568,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Only downside of the dinner was that we were sat in the furthest back table of the restaurant and the service was pretty slow.
7569,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,We started playing tetris with our plates to make room for new ones.
7570,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,For the price I fork up for freaking frozen hot chocolate I should at least get decent service.
7571,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,How do you expect us to have a dinner if you can't even fit all the food on the table!
7572,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"3) Checking in, we waited in a line for 15 minutes and when we got to the front desk, they said we needed to get back in line in 20 minutes because the line to get in after that line was too long (it was really short so we scratched our heads)."
7573,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Service could be faster since it wasn't a full house but oh well, we were on vacation."
7574,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I had no idea why they gave us these rubber pot holders as nothing I got was hot.
7575,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,A meal is less appreciated when the service sucks.
7576,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,This time the server ignored us.
7577,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"When I went for dessert, four dishes in a row were completely gone, empty serving trays."
7578,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,We had to ask a busboy for help.
7579,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Still, they didn't provide us a larger table but moved my brother (who was part of the group of 5) to another table across the restaurant to dine alone."
7580,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"When we were ready to leave, we had to flag down a bus boy to take our bill and credit card."
7581,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I enjoyed taking the pictures of the cute cupcakes and trying the edible decorations though :P

Minus 1 star though because of this though: I didn't like that they took your picture for you and promised to pass them out to you at your table (no mention of price)."
7582,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"While the food was fantastic, the quality of service was nowhere near where it should be for a restaurant of this caliber and the great food was not enough to overcome the horrendous service."
7583,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"It did take a little while for our bill to come after the meal, but who cares, we were stuffed and needed a minute to just sit around anyway."
7584,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The service was also better at the Wicked Spoon.
7585,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"For $50, I think I am entitled to pile my plate if I choose, but management came around and literally limited the quantity of meats per person."
7586,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"The manager replied back, ""So are you going to eat your food or leave?"""
7587,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I understand that this restaurant turns over a lot of drunk ladies, but I expect cleanliness in a restaurant with no exceptions or extenuating circumstances."
7588,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Not only that but the service is lackluster.
7589,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,That being said I understand that it's not the servers fault.
7590,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,The service is a bit spotty and I had to flag down some one on a few occasions.
7591,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I was seated in a corner with a server who seemed to think\/treated me as if I could not afford or was not privileged enough to dine there.
7592,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,I was beyond hungry that I lost my appetite when we finally reached the front of the line.
7593,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I would have gave this place a 4 for the food and ambiance,  but the service here is poor."
7594,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,i will put a picture up of the manager txting the whole time we needed service!
7595,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Reason for me taking one star away, is the service:
Sadly, both times, it has been pretty bad."
7596,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"There is always a huge wait for Gordon Ramsay's BurGR joint, but if you make friends with a Diamond Level (or higher) casino player (or if you happen to be one yourself), you can skip the regular line completely -- cutting the wait time down to 1-15 minutes versus 35-75 minutes."
7597,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Food flavors were great service was terrible the waitress Spilled water on us never came to clean it up we had to send a burger back twice because it wasn't cooked to our specifications and they forgot a burger
7598,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Service: I deducted 1 star because the waitress was not very attentive and we waited a while until she came to give us the bill.
7599,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"I totally understand if the host provided us the wrong information, but Grace didn't have to explain it in such a rude way."
7600,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,My one complaint with this place is that our waitress was the type of girl that didn't seem to like social interaction...
7601,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Other Vegas buffets have great tofu\/soy options so I'm hoping in the future the Wicked Spoon will follow suit.
7602,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The Frangria is still GREAT but the food was not.
7603,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"THE MOST GLAMOROUS OF THE GLAMOROUS HOTELS
EVERYTHING IS THERE
ENCORE, SURRENDER, ENCORE BEACH, XS
why not the good food right?"
7604,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"I felt the selection was lacking, service was slow, and the price just really didn't match up with the amount of sub-par food I was able to consume."
7605,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The food here is to die for.
7606,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"I hate to throw away food, but I had to push my plate to the side and let our waitress take it."
7607,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Some dishes had their own little pot or own little plate however this did become an issue when it was time to put food on your plate (spacing).
7608,FOOD#NEGATIVE,But most of the other dishes I tried were just OK.
7609,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The best thing about the Buffet is the huge array of food, but that doesn't matter too much when you don't enjoy the majority of it."
7610,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Food quality is better than average (best in Vegas), but service is horrible."
7611,FOOD#NEGATIVE,After trying to make the best of it we became increasingly unhappy with the food and service and complained.
7612,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Nothing special about those dishes.
7613,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I was glad they served baguette  so I was able to eat something.
7614,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Not a big deal but after finding out about the cutbacks on king crab legs, then my other favorite buffet item ran out for the day, I left very unhappy.. and feeling jipped."
7615,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Save room for dessert, we tried two different ones during our trip and preferred the Sundae's over the frozen hot chocolate which is really a glorified $11 milkshake...the sundae however was amazing!"
7616,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The lamb was really good but that was probably the only other type of food that stuck out out of everything that was offered.
7617,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"They had a few selections of pie\/cake that were ok, but they just have a standard ice cream machine like you might find at Ponderosa."
7618,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"As we walked along, we had to keep coming back to the table because after you pick up 2 or 3 items, you barely have any food but you have all these damm freakin little pots and baskets and stuff."
7619,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I felt like for the quality that this buffet was supposed to be at that the options would have been more plentiful.
7620,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"During my experiences, I had to admit I was a bit disappointed at the service and the food."
7621,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Comparing this buffet to Spice Market buffet over at Planet Hollywood, I think Spice Market had more variety."
7622,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The two stars are for the restaurant I give the waitress 5 stars for taking my cold burger back and making sure it was hot the second time around .
7623,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The desserts were a disappointment as I know it is one of their strengths yet the chef was not able to tell me which ones contained nuts since my wife is deathly allergic.
7624,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I got in and the assortment was in no comparison to the bacchanal  buffet .
7625,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"All the food was to die for and if you are a burger enthusiast like I am... you probably wouldn't want to have another burger ever, unless it was from here!"
7626,FOOD#NEGATIVE,What place is all out of root beer for root beer floats and out of cookies and cream ice cream for their Oreo Sundae?
7627,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"It's a-ok which is totally a-ok.

Sunday night dinner: 3 - 3.5\/5 stars

There were no stations for fresh, made to order items like pasta, crepes, salads, etc."
7628,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I tried the angry mac and cheese and the only thing angry about it was my taste bud.
7629,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Not as many choices as some of the other buffets on the strip but the quality of food is good.
7630,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Ambiance is lovely

Food is Ok, there aren't many choices, especially for sea food."
7631,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I only wish that the restaurant served steak tartare...
7632,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Weekend brunch is usally the bestbet then the dinner, try not to go there during lunch, since the selection is not as good then night time."
7633,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I would have liked regular ketchup better for the fries but again - it was part of the experience.
7634,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Having already experienced Pin Kaow Thai on Rainbow, Archie's Thai Kitchen on Flamingo, and Archi's Thai Cafe on Sahara, I am displeased with Lotus' serving size for Pad Se-Ew, which is stir-fried wide rice noodles with eggs, choice of chicken, and Chinese broccoli with black soy sauce."
7635,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"I've eaten at some of the other restaurants there, and they must be running the second string in the buffet, because the food in the other wynn places is noticeably better, and about the same price range (though not all you can eat)....

Worth a go if you are a seafood fan, but also not worth going too far out of your way."
7636,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"If I had one wish, it would be a wider array of ethnic cuisines."
7637,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"While I personally have always left Lotus full (and sometimes even with leftovers), it is true that the portions are smaller than at your average ten-pound-plate American restaurant."
7638,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The dessert bar was just alright and not enough fruits for me to end my meal!
7639,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Sushi: disappointing as well, there were only a few rolls and none of them were something you couldn't get at a grocery store."
7640,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The sushi station is pathetic; I tried the salmon sushi & could hardly taste any salmon.
7641,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"We wished there were some classic  favorites: creme brulee, mini pie\/fruit tarts, cream puff type of mini bites."
7642,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The one reason I can't give them 5 stars is because they lack the variety that other buffets have.
7643,FOOD#NEGATIVE,My only complaint is with the ice water.
7644,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The only things that they severed  that I would even think of ordering at a restaurant were the mushroom & truffle soup and the red velvet whoopie pie

All things considered, I would much rather go to the Bellagio Buffet, save the $20\/person and get better food"
7645,FOOD#NEGATIVE,They probably only had a handful of different dishes when the time changed.
7646,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Sure, The Cosmo looks nice and the way the food is presented looks delicious, but it's actually really bland and sometimes stale."
7647,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Definitely limited options for vegetarians.
7648,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Unfortunately there were no oysters, which is what he really wanted."
7649,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The variety is not that big.
7650,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"They do not have as many items as Bachannal, but then again you may not need as much when you taste Wicked Spoon's offerings."
7651,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The food was not seasoned well.
7652,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"I went for breakfast, and there was no king crab in sight- just Jonah crab, which is second-tier in comparison, and difficult to eat."
7653,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"i hated when I go to some buffets, though they have variety of choices, but they cannot make ONE DISH right."
7654,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The sushi bar did not have variety.
7655,FOOD#NEGATIVE,There is nothing unusual at the buffet.
7656,FOOD#NEGATIVE,They didn't have much flavors to choose from in the gelato section except for the basic flavors.
7657,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The food choice is smaller than the Bellagio, but the food is better."
7658,FOOD#NEGATIVE,2 out of the 3 dishes were just totally wrong.
7659,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Seafood selection was pathetic, probably only a handful to choose from: shrimp cocktail (nothing exciting), scallops (dry due to sitting under the food heat lamp), couple of seafood sushi, and Chinese pan fried shrimps (didn't even try because their batter looked thick and oily)."
7660,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"They are not as ambitious as Bellagio, so don't expect as much variety or as many of the fancier dishes."
7661,FOOD#NEGATIVE,+Dessert selection was amazing... pity I had no more room to indulge.
7662,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"--they didn't have prime rib, or any high quality (beef) steaks for that matter."
7663,FOOD#NEGATIVE,After waiting in line for almost 2 hours after the time we got in the queue system I have had better food at $15 Chinese buffets.
7664,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The seafood section was lackluster.
7665,FOOD#NEGATIVE,i honestly cant say the food was anything spectacular.
7666,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The bad- they were out of celery for my bloody mary, used a lime instead?"
7667,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"came here after--surprise surprise--a night of liquidation, and couldn't have found a better place for food."
7668,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Dessert station, not impressed either."
7669,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Someone walking out of the buffet at the end of his lunch warned me that they had run out of both salmon and bone marrow.
7670,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Under Ramsay's name, they should seriously work on the fries if more than a few customer complained about it already."
7671,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Crab legs looked & tasted like leftover scraps from another buffet.
7672,FOOD#NEGATIVE,A little too many blueberries for me but it was super yummy .
7673,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I thought Vegas buffets were good and cheap..boy was I wrong!!!
7674,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"a brunch should have other lunch meats roast beef, ham and turkey and they had churros which is a type of sugar donut which looked good until you bite into it."
7675,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"I am a huge sushi fan, half the reason why we chose this buffet, and their only choices were rolls that I can get at a grocery store."
7676,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Would not recommend this place for vegetarians.
7677,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"For dinner, I had the filet with merlot butter, which apparently was the same filet I had last time that I didn't especially like (but it still obviously looks good on the menu because I still got it)."
7678,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Anyway...the food selection is great, but one would have to walk his\/her way to the food section."
7679,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Their salad station was boring.
7680,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The waitress deducted the fries but in the end, the meal just wasn't enjoyed."
7681,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Drunken noodles with seafood: 0\/5 again, portion was small for the price."
7682,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The portion was small but the crispy rice on the bottom was enough to send us off the edge -- it was THAT good

Nuer Nam Tok -- a version of grilled beef but with toasted rice sprinkled all over giving the sauce a thick consistency which clung to the meat."
7683,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I'm glad I got the soup or I'd have still been hungry after that tiny sandwich.
7684,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Maybe I'm bad at selecting worthwhile entrees, or maybe Hash House focuses on presentation over taste."
7685,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"There is potential for this to be really good; however, the food must be hot when diners receive the food."
7686,FOOD#NEGATIVE,My orange Juice taste so much better  than my last 2 buffet from Harrah and Planet Hollywood casino.
7687,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The candy apples looked dangerous to eat but I heard were tasty.
7688,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"I liked the crab legs but they were cold, I wish they made them hot, there wasn't a wide variety of seafood in this buffet but the quality of food was good, the desert part was ok, they didn't have ice cream!"
7689,FOOD#NEGATIVE,My son said the salmon is dry and the kids options aren't great either.
7690,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"the food is no longer as delicious as i remembered, there were fewer options, and seafood did not seem fresh."
7691,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"If the dish were half the size and minus all the garnish, it could've actually been decent."
7692,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I will come back in hopes that the food got a little better though I admit it must be hard to make that much food every night.
7693,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"* Lox
*French Toast

* ALL the gourmet deserts
My faves were the chocolate Tiramisu cups and chocolate covered strawberries


Things that were blah
* The wait was ridiculous over an hour
* I drank 6 Bloody Marys and should have been buzzed
* A couple items were mediocre, but the really tasty ones made up for those ;)"
7694,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"It is the only buffet in Vegas that has an Asian food section serving up ramen, pho, hot and sour soup, wonton soup, miso soup, BBQ pork, roast pork, roast duck, AND pork soup dumplings (xiao long baos), to accompany a wide selection of dim sum and sushi edibles."
7695,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Super allergic to seafood so trying to find a buffet that isn't seafood heavy is challenging.
7696,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Good, quick, portion size is small though, consider ordering two if your really hungry."
7697,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The buffet is little smaller selection wise than other buffet on the strip, but it was quality food."
7698,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Maybe the dinner is better, but I wouldn't go again unless it was comped."
7699,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"A tad overwhelmed by the ridiculous portion, but every bite and every urge wanting to pass out was soooo worth it."
7700,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Selection is average.
7701,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Wish the food had better selection & quality.
7702,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I didn't like how there was only two shrimps in the cocktail as they probably chose quality over quantity for this one.
7703,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Lack of choices to eat.
7704,FOOD#NEGATIVE,They advertise to have 500 items for lunch buffets but I am sure they were much less.
7705,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The burgers don't come with fries though, so I added some truffle fries to my order."
7706,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"I was mildly disappointed that they didn't have raw oysters or a better selection of sushi, but their other dishes made up for it."
7707,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The plating was over-the-top, with some unneeded elements, but the flavor was definitely there."
7708,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"There's a few selections of Indian cuisine as well as Chinese, sushi, and a chilled seafood section (of course, Alaskan king crab legs)."
7709,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I was very disappointed and unimpressed with both he presentation and quality.
7710,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"They should remake the food selections ASAP

Pros:
* Locating in Cosmopolitan
* Their desert is the only thing good there
* They put many of their food in small cup\/pan\/pot

Cons:
* For the subpar food selection they offer right now, $40+\/person is a ripoff (Don't come here if you like seafood, their selection is very limited; they use crab legs the same level as those in $15-$20 asian buffet places)
* Most of their food doesn't taste like $40+ buffet, it was so plain and basic
* Their ambiance\/decor can be considered ""OK"" if it locates elsewhere not name Cosmopolitan, but for such an upscale trendy hotel like Cosmopolitan, Wicked Spoon should spend a little more money on the restaurant's ""vibe""
* Our waiter was discriminative."
7711,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"You definitely get your moneys worth, but the food is definitely not ideal to take to go when you can't finish your meal so try to find a dish wanted w your friend and just gooo for it."
7712,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The majority of the seafood options were served cold and the few warm options were just luke warm.
7713,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I've had better desserts at chain restaurants.
7714,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The food  quality and selection here seems to have down as I was reading my previous review.
7715,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The food and service was fantastic, up until an adolescent cockroach zoomed across our table during dessert."
7716,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Chinese dishes were typical cheap American Chinese food.
7717,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"On the negative side, the sandwiches are a touch on the small side and service was kinda painful."
7718,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Sure the one at Cesars has way better selection and almost the same quality, but the lines are way longer and it costs a lot more."
7719,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The sushi was rather disappointing, not enough selection and not tasty."
7720,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The gelatin tho is better tasting at the wynn.
7721,FOOD#NEGATIVE,But I ordered the Dover Sole dinner special {$35.95} and it was super bland.
7722,FOOD#NEGATIVE,One thing I was not impressed with and weighed heavily in giving this establishment a 3 out of five stars is the fact that I was unimpressed with the service.
7723,FOOD#NEGATIVE,There's not really a variety that I've seen at other buffets.
7724,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The selection is smaller than what I'm normally used to though.
7725,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"We found them to be a bit bland, a bit lacking in selection, basically just not as good as the Caesars's buffet, but a close second."
7726,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Salad Station 3 stars
When I go to salad stations at most other quality buffets there is an assortment of different vegetables; here, there was only the garden salad mixed greens, some chopped cucumbers, carrots, tomatoes, and grilled chicken which I got from the Caesar salad area."
7727,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Although portions were a lot, taste of food was not worth it."
7728,FOOD#NEGATIVE,If you like simplier food this may not be for you.
7729,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I think I was expecting more artful presentation and exotic flavors; I got some good flavors and generic presentation.
7730,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Aside from the prime rib (it was good but small) they were serving up Kobe beef the night I went.
7731,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Red Lobster probably serves better seafood than this place, and at half the cost."
7732,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Not a seafood lovers so not too many other choices.
7733,FOOD#NEGATIVE,They have a very basic selection of food- but better!
7734,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Not nearly as cool or fun of a presentation, but definitely a better burger."
7735,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I don't like huge portions and sugar saturated foods.
7736,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"By the time the 2nd plate came around, I had no more to eat."
7737,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Each year, the quality & the range of delightful food options gets worse & worse."
7738,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Other pros: I ate tons of cocktail shrimp (they came in twos), the tartare (I think it was veal) in a cone appetizer was amazing

Others cons: sushi selection was poor, dessert selection was pretty bland aside from the ice-cream, asian section wasn't even worth existing."
7739,FOOD#NEGATIVE,All the entrees were bad except for my sons wings...they were ok...not good but ok.  Don't fool yourself..this is not a good place to eat.
7740,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Tasty, but I would have preferred it to be served in a traditional shake glass."
7741,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Theres not ALOT of selection and theres always a line to get food.
7742,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Went there around 9pm and the food was mostly gone.
7743,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Our server didn't mention how huge their food portions were!
7744,FOOD#NEGATIVE,i seriously thought it was canned salmon till i picked around more and saw and semi not broken piece.
7745,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Anyway; they have Turkey bacon (boring!)
7746,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Seafood Station:  2 stars
Once again I was disappointed by the lack of variety."
7747,FOOD#NEGATIVE,In meat section we don't eat beef so we were hoping for some nice lamb chops or something but they only had lamb T-bone which was extremely tough and after struggling with it for few minutes we just gave up on it.
7748,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Not sure if the offerings are different on weekdays versus weekends, but on a Tuesday night, I didn't think they had THAT much to offer."
7749,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The selection was mediocre and the execution of dishes was subpar.
7750,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The portions were very big but the food itself was not amazing.
7751,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The entrees however missed several notes:

- Many of the dishes were way over seasoned this time: Korean Galbi, mushroom risotto, and cocktail shrimp."
7752,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"They have a $2.50 split plate charge*, but unless you eat like a linebacker, are a 300 foot tall lizard, or plan to take it home, you will be wasting a lot of food."
7753,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I went left to right but could not find an item to hit the spot.
7754,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Not sure why portion sizes are inconsistent.
7755,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Having a Mexican station with a taco bar would be an easy and popular addition.
7756,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Please, please, please add some more veggie options, so I can come with my wife."
7757,FOOD#NEGATIVE,They will have the typical food you expect at buffets but I noticed there are not as many of those prepared dishes with multiple ingredients if that makes sense.
7758,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Food, Service, Location deserves the 5 stars, but cannot hand those ratings out with impunity."
7759,FOOD#NEGATIVE,For brunch they do not have seafood like crab and such so thats dissapointing because bacchanal had it all day.
7760,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I was a little disappointed with the lack of options but we had the banana shake and it was fantastic.
7761,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The biggest annoyance of this place was that only about 30% of the food was labeled.
7762,FOOD#NEGATIVE,There was a wide selection of food items at the buffet but it was all pretty mediocre.
7763,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"However, the selection is too limited and price too expensive to give it 5 stars."
7764,FOOD#NEGATIVE,So much was on my plate that I felt like certain things lost flavor.
7765,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The problem is that they have a great idea make small Tapa size plates of food great to try and a good presentation.
7766,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Tillamook is good, but they could definitely improve the cheese selection."
7767,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Holding on to my last two stars for the long-ish wait for the food itself, the griminess, and the lack of options for breakfast."
7768,FOOD#NEGATIVE,It's just way too sweet and very hard to swallow after the inital sip.
7769,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"I split a mushroom omelette - big mistake, the portions here are not as big as Hash House lol so definitely coulda finished this on my own."
7770,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The worst for me was the lack of signage.
7771,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Roasted pork loin and plain ole mashed taters(poorly done) should not be on a buffet you are dropping 50 bucks on.
7772,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I've been here a handful of times and I'm never really wowed by the food.
7773,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The bright side, the dessert are actually quite decent, so if you're into sweets, you would love the buffet more than I did."
7774,FOOD#NEGATIVE,But one thing that sucked was that they didn't have a huge selection.
7775,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"They don't even offer the simple things such as: french fries, or Cesar salad!"
7776,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"While the food was decent, the price cannot be justified for how mediocre majority of the stuff offered on the buffet."
7777,FOOD#NEGATIVE,What was once a generous portion of potato salad (think 6 oz) was now 2-3 oz!
7778,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"I had a bunch of different items from the buffet, but none were very good."
7779,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Overall, this place has only a few things you will enjoy, the rest will make some starving country in Africa pissed off that you wasted your food!!"
7780,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The Congee is cooked mainland style, so there is no salt or meats in it."
7781,FOOD#NEGATIVE,There were no fruits or cream to fill your crepe.
7782,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I don't normally do buffets mainly because the quality of food at such a high quantity is so low.
7783,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The waffle, on the other hand was good, except the little tin cup of syrup was placed on the waffle itself."
7784,FOOD#NEGATIVE,-Variety: They don't have that many.
7785,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"About the foods, they have a small Chinese section with horrible dim-sum options."
7786,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Going through the photos others have provided, there were many items I see that were not available when we went."
7787,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The meat section was not that impressive.
7788,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The only kind of crab they had was snow crab, which didn't taste that great."
7789,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Although, I do wish they had more seafood options, the food was definitely spectacular!"
7790,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The desserts were good but I think the Rio or Bellagio buffets have better choices.
7791,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"They have decent selections, but was disappointed in their salad, cold dish appetizer section."
7792,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"I just wish, being that it's The Wynn, there was a bit more to choose from, and that their crab legs were served hot instead of on ice."
7793,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"There was definitely the potential for this meal to be great, but there needs to be more flavor.. more textural variation.. a kick!"
7794,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Found it odd to have a biscuit with my meal.
7795,FOOD#NEGATIVE,There are certain desserts and items that I could do without.
7796,FOOD#NEGATIVE,One dish I do not recommend is any of the dips.
7797,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"I hate the huge menu's, it was difficult to peruse their offerings at our small table of 4."
7798,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Not the best in town, and no clear vegitarian\/vegan options."
7799,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The sushi selection was really boring and quality was OK.
7800,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Tried several desserts --- not impressed.
7801,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"It was a good experience, and the food was good."
7802,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I was very disappointed to experience such a poor quality and selection of food.
7803,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Some breakfast items were still out, which was a bummer since we paid for lunch - who wants scrambled eggs at these prices?!"
7804,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"old and  awful taste pizza, old sushi, chewy prime ribs, a lot of dishes are tasteless, most of the dishes are basic, small dessert areas"
7805,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"I don't mind paying that price if the food was good, or the selection was vast."
7806,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The bigger meat dishes just fell flat and were a bit boring.
7807,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Lotus of Siam will have all the familiar Thai dishes-- pad thai, drunken noodles, Tom Yum Koong soup, shaking beef, papaya salads, stir fry vegetables, fried bananas for dessert, coconut and brown rice and curry."
7808,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"I would, however, give this place another chance for the food and maybe different flavored drink."
7809,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The Food: 

- It was good but lacked the more gourmet items of Bacchanal (Caesar's), Wicked Spoon (Cosmopolitan), and even Bellagio Buffet."
7810,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Over all, good flavors, small-ish portions, in-attentive service."
7811,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Dessert selection was also unimpressive.
7812,FOOD#NEGATIVE,But did not have lobster and king crab that I was expecting for this kind of price.
7813,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The $29 brunch seemed a bit pricey to me, but I was willing to pay for it given the quality of the food."
7814,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Dessert options were awesome...dozen+ gelato options, sugar free options, so many little cakes, cookies, fruit options."
7815,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Definitely not worth going back again for the food and service.
7816,FOOD#NEGATIVE,i think the seafood station could've been better with smaller \/ fresher oysters and bigger crab legs.
7817,FOOD#NEGATIVE,They also lacked good pairing options.
7818,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Food was no bueno, best thing this place has was the shrimp cocktail."
7819,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I just felt the food had no flavor.
7820,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The only seafood was smocked salmon, nothing else, if you liked seafood buffet, that definitely isn't a good choice, I didn't even get enough to eat since there were no many options!"
7821,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Then the cashier said the words that absolutely broke my heart: ""We don't have the Earl Cobb Wrap""."
7822,FOOD#NEGATIVE,decor and food much less impressive than wynn.
7823,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The line to get the food is ridiculously long.. even in the dessert there was a line.. desserts not that great compared to M buffet.
7824,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The combination of everything just feels boring.
7825,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Even Golden Corral has more selection and better tasting than 5 star hotel.
7826,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"I had a large number of dishes to sample...none of them inventive, none of them delicious and none of them memorable in any way."
7827,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The food was great but the location in Palm Casino was not the best.
7828,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Basically, the food looks great but tastes underwhelming and disappointing for its price - any other $50 buffet would be better (i.e."
7829,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Dessert was limited too, no basic dishes to be found like creme brûlée, tiramisu, coconut gelato."
7830,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I am very disappointed at the food selection.
7831,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"At the same time, the complaints other reviewers had about a food running out and not being refilled was also my experience."
7832,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"the farm burger was really good but I wished they had a side or the option of lettuce, onion and tomatoes.."
7833,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I think a sweeter or more tea flavor would've been nice.
7834,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"In the past, usually there would be options to choose from medium rare to medium well, but this time everything is medium rare except beef wellington and ostrich."
7835,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"This was the favorite buffet of my husband and his family, but I felt it lacked quality non-seafood choices which dampened my enjoyment because I'm allergic to seafood."
7836,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Sushi was just OK. Dessert bar was still very good but they started running out of gelato and were limiting the portions.
7837,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Their sushi selection is horrible.... but so is almost all of Vegas Buffets.
7838,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"FOOD - 3 stars...quantity makes way for a relative mediocrity
AMBIANCE - 3 stars...something of a pig trough in an Italian villa
SERVICE - 4 stars...they keep those dishes moving
TOTAL - 3 stars...accommodates our worst excesses...but at least for a fixed price"
7839,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"It is nowhere close to a quality buffet - not in selections, not in taste and it's all about presentation."
7840,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I don't feel like the selection was bigger than other strip buffets.
7841,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Keep in mind, the food is very tasty and that is why I'm still giving it an A-OK rating but the portion sizes are seriously offensive."
7842,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Point of note, if the server warns you twice about how hot something is, take the advice."
7843,FOOD#NEGATIVE,-poor signage and labeling of food items.
7844,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Anyway, the food was mediocre at best, but the choices were so slim I was shocked."
7845,FOOD#NEGATIVE,No sign of macarons though.
7846,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I doubt I will ever do Vegas Buffets again because it doesn't seem worth it for the price point.
7847,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"1 star off: okay selection or choices
1 star off: It's just a sandwich, guys..."
7848,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The price is expensive at $65 for 2 people for sub par food taste, quality, selection, ambiance, and decor."
7849,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"For a ""seafood buffet"" you would think there would be more seafood dishes."
7850,FOOD#NEGATIVE,After all the Escargots disappeared I had an idea to dip my bread into the pesto sauce that was still in the pan.
7851,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Hopefully they'll either raise their standards and selection back to the quality of  this buffet when it opened or at least lower their prices-- because I would love to be able to amend my review and give the Wicked Spoon the 5 stars I would have when it first opened!
7852,FOOD#NEGATIVE,It's a small buffet with a a mediocre size selection and variety.
7853,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Disappointed in the selection of the food (very little for a buffet) but everything tasted great!
7854,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I didn't care for the gelato though.
7855,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The ramen was the only thing I was able to finish.
7856,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"As for the downsides:  the plates were wet and smelled fishy, the fried rice was hard, the music was way too loud, and the hot dog buns were hard."
7857,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I rather spend money at a place with more veggie options.
7858,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"We really liked dinner so we were actually hoping that lunch would something different and good too, but it was really the same food so the second time was a little disappointing, mostly because we wanted some new stuff."
7859,FOOD#NEGATIVE,There are no crab legs unfortunately and the dessert selection was not as good as last year.
7860,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The food alone is worth 4 stars but Alex with the glasses made me give 5 stars!
7861,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Real oxtail broth.
7862,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The Asian and Italian dishes were all awful, and I tried multiple ones."
7863,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The final nail in the Hash House coffin, the food aint that good."
7864,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Use to be the BEST in town
Now the FIRST PLACE is BACCHANAL at caesar palace
I do not recommend anymore the buffet
You would be dIsappointed
We could have thought that after beeing so good they would have make a special effort at the apperance of bacchanal
It is the contruary
Chinese food is not varied and no good
Meat is very poor
Pizzas are awfull
Salads and vegetables with no taste
Deserts are a désolation
Ice cream a joke 
Used to be a huge fan no more !!"
7865,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"It really is quite a simple creation that has a different name people aren't familiar with (outside of the Yelp praise), and thus they mistakenly value it higher than any other chain which could easily supplant it."
7866,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Service was good and its a nice room but the food was not very good.
7867,FOOD#NEGATIVE,This is technically a review update as I was originally working on a 2-star review for this restaurant (had dinner with friends during a bachelorette party and it was TERRIBLE for both food and service).
7868,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Can't go wrong with this dish IMHO
- Druken noodles fried duck- small portions for $27 Greasy don't know why so much hype over this dish."
7869,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The selection of food was vast, but the quality of food was poor."
7870,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The shrimp by itself is not much food so it will give you the ability to try more dishes.
7871,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"From the pictures I saw before coming here, I thought the food section was larger."
7872,FOOD#NEGATIVE,To our surprise the choice of food was very few for a $60 dinner!
7873,FOOD#NEGATIVE,BF didn't like the lemonade even though his tea of choice is Earl Grey.
7874,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Burgers are way overpriced for what you get.
7875,FOOD#NEGATIVE,and lastly the dessert maybe small in scale compare to the Wynn but was scrumptious and different.
7876,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"On the outlook the food looks impressive but having had other buffets, I felt the food choice and taste was actually a little disappointing."
7877,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"There was a couple of breakfast idems on the buffet, but mostly Chinese food, seafood, italian food, dried meats, cheese's, sushi ect."
7878,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"This restaurant loses a star because of limited options for vegetarians, and the exorbitant price...the rest is great...if possible, get a seat in the fun 'garden' area"
7879,FOOD#NEGATIVE,And I see steamed is not an option huh - for the price we pay?!?
7880,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Now, the problems... all of the proteins (meat, chicken, etc.)"
7881,FOOD#NEGATIVE,there's nothing really special about it.
7882,FOOD#NEGATIVE,:( Perhaps it wasn't meant to be spicy...I would say the chicken itself was not jerk chicken.
7883,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Good news is no waiting line and price is cheaper, bad news is that the choices of the food is quite limited."
7884,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Either they slacked off the day we went, or they are always lacking in dessert options."
7885,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"6) 


Lowlights:
1) Seafood: This selection was disappointing...the king crab legs were not very meaty compared to other buffets I have been to."
7886,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The food item options are quite limited as well.
7887,FOOD#NEGATIVE,This is just a sign that they don't care about controlling the flow of food and giving customers the best food possible.
7888,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The buffet came in at $10.99 and was severely  lacking in options.
7889,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The burger choices were no more outstanding than you can find at other burger specialty restaurants on the strip.
7890,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"But I do want some roughage when I'm cannibalizing on a fresh, juicy piece of french duck in America's city of excess."
7891,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Also the food i would classify it as a bit more pretentious than other buffets.
7892,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Food presentation isn't the greatest but you'll be happy with the taste.
7893,FOOD#NEGATIVE,But there were not that many food options as I expected.
7894,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"nothing is made in a big hotel pan , where you have to take a scoop of the same crap that everyone else has been touching for the past half hour."
7895,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"I tried literally every dish, and less than 50% tasted good."
7896,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"However, we were sad to learn that unlike other restaurants we were used too, they weren't serving their usual breakfast menu at that time."
7897,FOOD#NEGATIVE,All I could think of is when Gordon himself sits down at these restaurants and spits food out haha I wanted to do this no lie.
7898,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"It is world famous people came here, television networks came here, I gave it a 4 only because, with a group they split the check in 2 per check, no individual, the lunch portions are too small."
7899,FOOD#NEGATIVE,DIY strawberry shortcake section - DOES IT LOOK LIKE I WORK HERE?
7900,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Also, if you are vegetarian or have food allergies do not come here."
7901,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Price i cant complain as our meal was comp due to a cockroach decided to join us for brunch.
7902,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The crab was still frozen and small!!
7903,FOOD#NEGATIVE,And the desserts - what few were offered - were no better than supermarket or Cool Whip-based quality.
7904,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"While they had gelato, the other options were rather standard fair for a casino dessert buffet."
7905,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Now it's not different and probably a poorer quality and selection than other hotels on the strip.
7906,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Downside...lots of filler material.
7907,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The only decent thing was the fries but even they had too much parm on them.
7908,FOOD#NEGATIVE,She said they closed the crab legs station which meant that the other three would not be getting any !!!
7909,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I did wish they had a better sushi bar and meat carving section.
7910,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"However, until further improvements have been made on service and food, I do not recommend nor I will go back to this buffet for the price and the ""Super luxury"" buffet that they claimed themselve to be."
7911,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"But in terms of the variety of food, it doesn't yet beat Caesars Bacchanal, but do keep in mind it's significantly different in price."
7912,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Seafood unfortunately was no different the anywhere else.
7913,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Like most vegans, I am prepared to compromise at most places and won't mark them down for having a limited vegan selection but I was expecting more from a Wynn establishment."
7914,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Pay if you must to get the experience but watch your food...
7915,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I didn't like how low the salads were.
7916,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"After all the hype from friends about how great this place was, my Saturday dinner buffet, as far as the food was concerned, they were a total disappointment."
7917,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Food = 2 stars.
7918,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"This time, we went to a weekday breakfast buffet ($20.99 pp) and despite lack of seafood (no crab nor shrimp on the Friday buffet) I enjoyed it immensely."
7919,FOOD#NEGATIVE,There wasn't much of an option.
7920,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Overall the quality of the individual items are pretty good, but the selection is kind of a turn off if you are really looking for that."
7921,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Con: Lack of beef dishes.
7922,FOOD#NEGATIVE,We expected the brunch menu to be a little bigger (they only had about 5 main items).
7923,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"But for buffet, the selections were limited."
7924,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The deserts were the prime example of presentation but no substance.
7925,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The only thing is that they only offer this til January, so make sure to run over and snatch one up!"
7926,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Just not very vegetarian friendly unless you like eating a boring cheese sandwich.
7927,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Came here on a mini trip, no drinking at all the night before , all my taste buds were intact and every single One displeased and disappointed by the food ."
7928,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"We don't see a carving station at lunch time, and no crab legs or scrimp cocktails, etc."
7929,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The desserts, like the other sections, lacked variety and even the basics."
7930,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"As an asian, they look lousy to me and typical selection of the Korean short ribs."
7931,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"After reading all the positive Yelp reviews and looking at the photos of the food, I wasn't impressed with their weekday brunch."
7932,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The food choices are limited for the price of $38 per person.
7933,FOOD#NEGATIVE,None of my friends were able to find hangover friendly fare either.
7934,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"It was ok.  Maybe only 1 item on the buffet had any protein in it; most everything else was noodles, rice, and vegetables only."
7935,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"I definitely noticed a downgrade of food offerings, diminshing food quality, and overall service was lacking."
7936,FOOD#NEGATIVE,It's REALLY good Thai food that doesn't just include Pad Thai and Pad See Ew.
7937,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The fries that I got also tasted stale like they had been sitting for half the day.
7938,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The original location always asks me if I want to customize.
7939,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Now everything is served lukewarm, and half the food is only fit for peasants."
7940,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The food was good, not great."
7941,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"No salmon, king crabs, or any of that stuff needed for a good buffet."
7942,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The kha nom jean nam ngyow (#G, $9.95) is a non-spicy pork and rice vermicelli dish that reminds me slightly of a certain Vietnamese dish called bun rieu, but I wouldn't have this one again as it seemed a bit boring compared to some other dishes."
7943,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"A lot of dishes are served in individual plates; cute, but unfortunately leads to cold food as well."
7944,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"So basically, we received huge piles of terrible food!!"
7945,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The waffle cone itself tasted like a fortune cookie gone wrong.
7946,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Cheese and meat section was so tiny and there was no item to pair it with.
7947,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"EXCELLENT buffet :)

The only part of the buffet that I didn't quite enjoy was the Asian selection...but hey...the rest of it made up for it all the way!"
7948,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Although the menu selection isn't as vast as most, the quality of the dishes are unparalleled by most vegas buffets."
7949,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Each dish had a lot of flavor which complemented the seafood of choice.
7950,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"This buffet does not have much of a selection, and most of the food looked unappetizing."
7951,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The only criticism is that the brunch menu had very limited breakfast options and mostly served lunch.
7952,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The buffet was less than average, prime rib tasted like Chuck steak, crab tasted like it had been brined for years, NO cocktail shrimp or oysters for a $45 buffet."
7953,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Other than that, the menu looked pretty cool and the limited amount of choices helped us know what we want to eat."
7954,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"If you are on a budget do yourself a huge favor and go out to eat somewhere more cheaper where they are more attentive and caring about their customers and you will more than likely still have a lot of that money leftover from the $140+ I have spent here .....and ended up hungry anyway....go see a show, go shopping, do anything else ......trust me you will be happier with your choice that throwing it away at this place
- Too much hype 
- Not worth it one bit
- Just regular food
- Bad or non existent customer service"
7955,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"That being said if you're hammered and just need to get some food in you, go for it, although you may wind up feeling like crap either way."
7956,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"And the garlic prawns were nice, but as someone else noted the portion was small in comparison to the price."
7957,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"After trying some food, the food seemed plain."
7958,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Food items were also not regularly replenished and when I inquired about the sushi which had run out, the staff did not appear apologetic about that and expressed no interest in replenishing the items."
7959,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The chanterelles were great, but there were not too many of them and this premium ingredient was kind of lost in the sandwich."
7960,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The one thing I have to say that might be seen as a disadvantage, well I saw it as one, was that some of the food items were plated on an individual plate."
7961,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"If I am paying 50.00 for breakfast, I want a freaking poached egg white."
7962,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The food offerings here are mostly standard for Vegas buffets: salad bar, crab legs, sushi, dessert bar."
7963,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I came here on a Thurs night and spent about $30 for food that didn't taste good.
7964,FOOD#NEGATIVE,If you are looking for large portions of  strange new combinations of food; this is the place for you.
7965,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Very few choices of food.
7966,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Overall, we were not impressed with the food and service there."
7967,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Selection was limited and was s very generic buffet.
7968,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Not a good choice if you are vegan\/vegetarian.
7969,FOOD#NEGATIVE,There seem to be so many better burger places on the strip.
7970,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Eggs were runny and no flavor and the breakfast meats were just ok.  We had hoped that as they switched out breakfast to lunch that the selections would be better, and the answer was a HUGE NO."
7971,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Food was food nothing special.
7972,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"I felt that their brunch focused a lot on baked goods (muffins, croissants, cookies) over hot food, which was a little disappointing."
7973,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"(Drooling) The price is pretty reasonable for its deliciousness & in the city, however the portions are smaller than the usual Thai restaurants I go to."
7974,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"I can guarantee you if it was Gordon Ramsay that made the burger, it'd be exquisite but this was nothing but a shame on his name."
7975,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The fresh squeezed orange juice was awesome when it got there, but the only other thing that really stood out was their awesome dessert island."
7976,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Everything was delicious, although they could offer some creamed horseradish rather than just the fresh horseradish at the cold seafood station."
7977,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"I have heard so much about bacchanal buffet at Caesars so went there to check it out during my recent stay in Vegas, I have to say I was highly disappointed."
7978,FOOD#NEGATIVE,My only complaint was the lack of oysters on the half shell and seafood pizza.
7979,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I talked to the server and explained and she said they would throw it back on the grill.
7980,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Fruit was disappointing (bowl of grapes, cantaloupe, pineapple or honeydew) as I'm used to seeing better options at this price point of buffets (strawberries, blueberries, mangos etc?)"
7981,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Would not recommend this place if you're used to real French food.
7982,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I definitely would give this place a shot just to say you have been but I felt there breakfast and lunch menu could have been bigger and more diverse.
7983,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Small selection of sushi but the quality of the fish was great.
7984,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"They have the staples of dessert and some really good options, I would just like to see more variety."
7985,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Go here for the experience but don't expect for great food and service.
7986,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I seriously only liked one thing here - char su bao (bbq buns located in the dim sum area.)
7987,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Maybe I got spoiled by Bacchanal but the selection here is definitely inferior and the quality to match.
7988,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"First of all, where does all the seafood go?"
7989,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Also most of the food items do not change from day to day.This buffett no longer offers lamb chops on fridays,it also no longer has ice cream,but gellano  that just doesn't have the rich taste that the ice cream had."
7990,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The selection was a lot less than I expected.
7991,FOOD#NEGATIVE,She could not tell the prawn from the tail it was so stuck together.
7992,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"If you're searching for gf vegan menu, this restaurant doesn't offer that,  but many of the side options listed on the regular menu, such as brussels sprouts and sautéed mushrooms, are gf."
7993,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"They ran out of King crab, so they served whatever was left from day before an blended in a very few pieces with the snow crab to fool the customer (doesnt work) and then they ran out completely."
7994,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Yes it's not bacchanal and they stayed with more traditional choices for food and presentation but the quality was great for which is why it deserves 4 stars!
7995,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I also really like the way they just played the different types ugh salsas although the jars should have had a bigger openings so that way it wouldn't be so difficult to maneuver the spoon to get a spoonful of salsa or guacamole.
7996,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The chicken sandwich was just Alright and the portions are smaller than what they used to be.
7997,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"I gave this place four stars because the food was overwhelming and even though I did enjoy my crab cakes, there was just so much of it!"
7998,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Maybe we didn't order their signature shrimp dish but these other normal offerings should've been stellar if it is a good restaurant.
7999,FOOD#NEGATIVE,It is fun to watch people try to eat the candy apple... super thick sugar coating... impossible to eat.
8000,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"So then, I figure they couldn't mess up dessert but again I was disappointed, because the presentation looked so good!!!"
8001,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"I've seen bigger legs at Vegas buffets, so I was slightly disappointed."
8002,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Oddly disappointing: 

Meager sushi selection - they had out spam musubi and one other roll."
8003,FOOD#NEGATIVE,They had a very small selection of it and they didn't taste that great either.
8004,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Not a lot of variety in seafood at the time, just some salmon, shrimp cocktail, clams and sushi, but the meat was delicious."
8005,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Normally, when you order a multi-layer mountain of binge worthy food - the quality of each individual piece it's at its best but here it's the opposite!"
8006,FOOD#NEGATIVE,But I guess you can order 3 chicken and waffles and feed them all lmao.
8007,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Sushi and dessert... they still don't have a decent sushi section and dessert were very limited and is one of the only few that had only 3 items that were sugar-free.
8008,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Most of what they have on display is not even served on there buffet very deceiving!
8009,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I was expecting food portions to be larger.
8010,FOOD#NEGATIVE,This establishment is less frequented than other establishment which means more food is under the heat lamps longer than usual.
8011,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"This stew with meat and beans was okay, but I wouldn't order it again for the future."
8012,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The food was somewhat tasty, nothing greatly stands out, though."
8013,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I was picking chunks of pasta noodles and meat off my shirt and hair.
8014,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"worst place ever... don't ever go.... we decided to take a chance and go in .... looked like a fun place to have breakfast\/lunch.... never again... the wait was for 90 minutes even though they said 30 minutes and omg one of the girls in the front needs to get hired.. worst serve ever... she was very rude and people would walk up to her to ask a question and she would just ignore them....

after all that wait the food wasnt even good... just a freaken waste of time... dont waste your time by going in"
8015,FOOD#NEGATIVE,They changed a lot of the food stations for cheaper unappetizing dishes.
8016,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I think its in the same food level as your local apple bees and chili's.
8017,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"I ordered the bacon, egg and cheddar sandwich for breakfast and it wasn't very good at all."
8018,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I have had meals at Red Robbin and Subways that I have enjoyed more.
8019,FOOD#NEGATIVE,- Pig ear salad...total fail (you can't even crisp up the pig ears to add texture?)
8020,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Portion issues aside, the ham had a bit of a course texture but was otherwise nice and smokey with honey overtones
(+) Rotisserie chicken - Latin style, with decent chicken flavor that paired well with the leek; however it's on the dry side in comparison to your typical Costco rotisserie chicken
(+\/-) Char siu ribs - Creative concept, but unfortunately turned out more like dry ribs in need of BBQ sauce
(+\/-) Asian BBQ bacon - Again, better in concept."
8021,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I think even drunk me wouldnt have stomached the food they served.
8022,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Display \/ Information: 2\/10, signs on the wrong food, had no idea of what some dishes were & overheard a waiter ask if they were doing brunch or breakfast that day, so they weren't even sure, but they still charged $40."
8023,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Entrees are OK- Very basic french items such as skirt steak and frites.
8024,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"I don't understand how I place like the Wynn, as pricey as it is, can't figure out how to keep their buffet food warm."
8025,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"They have a lot of vegan options, so that made me happy."
8026,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"I was excited that one had opened up in Vegas and I wasn't disappointed with my sundae, but my friends that ordered regular food didn't recommend it."
8027,FOOD#NEGATIVE,All the portion is like a size of a shot glass or a bit bigger.
8028,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"One of the dishes was from the chef's special menu, and it was the khaoi saoi crispy duck curry (again, it had very little duck in it, and we paid almost $30 for it)."
8029,FOOD#NEGATIVE,There isn't as much variety as the Wynn Buffet and the desserts weren't as good but overall I enjoyed my experience and will return.
8030,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The amount of vanilla ice cream on top of the black gooey mess was more than I would put in a bowl for myself.
8031,FOOD#NEGATIVE,What I found was a fairly standard buffet with some very questionable food items.
8032,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Only thing missing were bacon and avocado, but purely because I looove those two ingredients on any burger or sandwich."
8033,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The selection went downhill.
8034,FOOD#NEGATIVE,But I would say that I was hoping their selection to be much expansive than it actually was.
8035,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The portion of foods were little.
8036,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I wouldn't come back as there are other better choices for food at that price range in Vegas.
8037,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The food was incredibly heavy and honestly, didn't feel much better than your local Olive Garden\/Cheesecake Factory."
8038,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The lines to get food were very long it kind of sucked but what do ya expect.
8039,FOOD#NEGATIVE,My hubby got the caprese sandwich and they left off the basil.
8040,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"i felt for this amount of money, the hype, the length of time, the mediocre service, and the quality of food, and lack of options- they deserve only one star."
8041,FOOD#NEGATIVE,It's like a freak show of food.
8042,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The variety was subpar.
8043,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"At around 37 bucks a pop for weekend dinner buffet, being a vegetarian...it's totally NOT worth it."
8044,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Let me just say that the buffet looks really nice, they have great presentation however the food tastes bland and just not that good, if you are a vegetarian DO NOT go to this buffet, but my friends who ate meat also did not like the food here, so my review is based upon both veggie\/meat eaters perspective."
8045,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The food is good as well but I ordered biscuits and gravy and it tastes like they opened a can of cat food and mixed it with gravy then served it to me.
8046,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Don't call it assorted if its 98% one fruit.
8047,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Dishes were not as good as they looked, it is more about presentation here."
8048,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Props to our waiter Cruz (who wasn't even really our waiter to begin with -- he was just the only one in our section actually collecting dishes and delivering drinks) for HAULING ASS and picking up everyone else's slack!!
8049,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Charcuterie and cheese station selection began with a very interesting and varied selection which as of our last visit had been scaled back.
8050,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Bacchanal is pretty pricey and the food\/selections are just okay.
8051,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Carving station is minimal, serving two items, but the Teriyaki marinated flank steak was done perfectly."
8052,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Unfortunately, the hot dishes disappointed."
8053,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"They had run out of a lot of my other favorites as well and even for the items that were left, there was a line."
8054,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Although this is cool, it definitely doesn't allow you to take a lot of food back to your table in one plate."
8055,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Pretty decor and furniture, but food does not match up =(

Probably will not return unless a friend insisted on coming again."
8056,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Everything was neat and clean which is good and the service was good, but the food didn't have the wicked flare as I was hoping for."
8057,FOOD#NEGATIVE,We were greatly disappointed upon finding out that they do not serve these foods anymore.
8058,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I was so disappointed at this buffet.
8059,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Nice experience, wonderful view, however the food has gone downhill since our last visit."
8060,FOOD#NEGATIVE,the asian station was sort of weak - sushi was not particularly good - but i guess you shouldn't be getting sushi rolls at a buffet joint anyway.
8061,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Aside from the flat sodas, the food overall is really good."
8062,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"If the area, I thought Wicked Spoon at Cosmo was better as far as food options."
8063,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The presentation is decent, but probably not great in terms of food handling."
8064,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"This is definitely the best burger place I've been to so far food-wise, but be warned: don't come here when you're starving because the wait (both for a table and then for the actual food to come) will probably make you faint."
8065,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"I didn't like the taste of coffee for some reasons, but I guess I'm just too picky."
8066,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"However, the DESSERTS were insane."
8067,FOOD#NEGATIVE,5) The food containers made it impractical to have more than 2 -3 dishes in a plate.
8068,FOOD#NEGATIVE,It loses a star because our food arrived Luke warm so it was a bit of a let down.
8069,FOOD#NEGATIVE,They had a slight yellow tinge in the meat and didn't taste very fresh.
8070,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"However, I don't think you necessarily go to this restaurant for dinner to enjoy the food but rather the view."
8071,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"At about $38 a person, I expected the dinner to be AMAZING and omggggggg, the food was incredible."
8072,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The portions of plated food are all going to be smaller naturally, but that's what makes this place annoying."
8073,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The selection isn't as vast as Wynn, but considering the cheaper price, I guess that's acceptable."
8074,FOOD#NEGATIVE,For a near $50 meal I expect a lot better quality control.
8075,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"I've always been a buffet type of guy n always want a buffet to have a good set of seafood selection, this place didn't have a good varieties of choices but it was good quality grub.word."
8076,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Limited selection of burgers that are not very creative.
8077,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Had it been hotter, it all would have been decent."
8078,FOOD#NEGATIVE,They charge an arm and a leg for food and dessert that is okay\/good...Not worth it in my opinion.
8079,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Asian section sucked worst har gow ever, sushi section was small and looked like cheap cheap sushi and the taste reflected it."
8080,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I noticed they had 2 breakfast stations which makes the selection even smaller.
8081,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"As it was I was very pleased with the the outer ribeye cap that they had sliced off of one of them for me as it is the best part of the cut imho...
http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=T1MSMPa-rJ4GoKkwTclsWg#M22z-WrpCtwH6p8Ce12LUQ

The dessert section was actually not as big as some buffets but still had a nice sampling of items."
8082,FOOD#NEGATIVE,It was quite tasty but the portion was way too small for $13.95.
8083,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Like I'm all for Asian-fusion, but this dish was a disaster."
8084,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I wish our experience with the service side was align with the quality of the food.
8085,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The general selection of food is basically what you find at every buffet in Vegas now.
8086,FOOD#NEGATIVE,There was nothing in this buffet I wanted to eat accept the dessert.
8087,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The fries were SUPER salty and their dipping sauces did not pair well in my opinion with the fries.
8088,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"One small gripe, the excellent baguettes are delivered with only a spreading knife to cut cut them."
8089,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"I probably wouldn't come here again as I could just watch the fountain show for free and with an even better view, and the food is not worth returning for."
8090,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The sandwich fell apart on me and the meat tasted weird.
8091,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The other dishes were mediocre and dessert was below average.
8092,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The sushi was pretty plain, could get better sushi at Whole Foods."
8093,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Not sure how they came out such a melted mess considering they came out so quickly, but we had to scoop the whipped cream back on to attempt a cute picture of them."
8094,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The service was AWFUL and the food was a letdown.
8095,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Although I've seen ads of the buffet having dim sum, they only had BBQ pork buns."
8096,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The food is to die for.
8097,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"I had the filet au poivre with brussels sprouts (I know, sad no frites)."
8098,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The selection is poorer than Todai buffet.
8099,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Food runs out and people line up for a long time to get in and find fewer food selections.
8100,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The crab legs were salty & when I went to order tacos at the Mexican food area I was told that they ran out of the meat that I was excited to try.
8101,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I am not a fan of seafood so I did not visit those stations and all.
8102,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"I've seen this place on various food and travel shows for years, but that frozen hot chocolate just isn't worth it."
8103,FOOD#NEGATIVE,seriously...french food sucks.
8104,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I have had Thai in many places and unfortunately this experience was not up there.
8105,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Only downside is some of the food is dry (kobe sliders, lamb chops)...big letdown."
8106,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I grabbed a few other items that were pretty sub par too.
8107,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Very disappointing meal.
8108,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Lemon garlic shrimp - 
Sushi - Not much selection and too much rice
Calamari - A little bit too salty for my taste
Crab Cakes
Ravioli
Angry Mac&Cheese
Salad - There was not much selection during this time

There was A LOT more food that I cannot think of."
8109,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"I hate cold food, and i hate ""fake"" gourmet food."
8110,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The food was sub-par and and it was $40.00 per person.
8111,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"If you're okay with just smoked salmon, shrimp cocktail, mussels and one or two fish dishes, then you'll enjoy it."
8112,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I didn't like the food.
8113,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"I agree with some of the other Yelpers though, I wish they had a little bigger selection on desserts."
8114,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The service was attentive, the décor was very beautiful... but the food itself was just ok at best."
8115,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"They had prime rib, several different kinds of fish, lobster ravioli ( you need to pick out the Lobsters in this dish), lamb, pan fried quail (not good at all - no taste and not very good texture even though it looked good), salads, kobe sirloins, etc."
8116,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Sushi options are limited and very average.
8117,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Holiday buffet is approx $60+ and the food is indeed so so.
8118,FOOD#NEGATIVE,They had very limited salad options.
8119,FOOD#NEGATIVE,But for $38 I was expecting a little better quality and better choices.
8120,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I hate it when a buffet runs about of something.
8121,FOOD#NEGATIVE,After a few bites I just didn't have a desire to continue eating anymore.
8122,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The mains and sides were good, seafood selection meh to poor and OMG the creme brûlée (get it!)."
8123,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"For the price around 8:15 pm, there was no crawfish or lobster & no cooked fish."
8124,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Not a large amount of food but plenty and large on flavor.
8125,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The only downside is that they wouldn't whip up some thousand island dressing but they do have really good chipotle and curry ketchups.
8126,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Indian restaurants are everywhere now,NYC, SFO  or Hollywood or even on Vegas strip.Chicken Tikka Masala is a  favorite for  millions of people,But Bellagio choose NOT to offer any Indian Dishes in their GRAND BUFFET."
8127,FOOD#NEGATIVE,I am thoroughly heartbroken about my experience here...Our bill came to about $200...um I think I've eaten a better meal at the outback!
8128,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Where do you get off charging $50 bucks (after taxes) for crap ass buffet that's short on items during the holidays?!
8129,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"They also do a mix of small personal plates, with normal buffet offerings you spoon onto your plate, which by the way can make things kind of weird, especially since the plates aren't all that big."
8130,FOOD#NEGATIVE,It was a little heavy but that is kind of expected for French food.
8131,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Second of all, I didn't even mind that there weren't enough biscuits because the giant hockey puck they tried to pass off as a biscuit was a dense mass that tasted like it was made yesterday."
8132,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Sad to say, the next batch didn't have the same perfect consistency as the first ones I've had."
8133,FOOD#NEGATIVE,This is very upsetting because the reason we went to the buffet was for the crab!
8134,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"There was very little wait at 11 am, however when we sat down we were presented with a minimal brunch menu of about 5-6 different items and no breakfast style cocktails (I probably could have asked for a Bloody Mary or Mimosa if I wanted, but neither was featured on the menu.)"
8135,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"In summary, novel concept, expensive for what you get, food choices limited compared to other Vegas fine buffets, and fairly long wait time."
8136,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"If you're reading this review in the future, hopefully the staff will be more prepared and the food choices will open up just a little by then."
8137,FOOD#NEGATIVE,It would have been better to serving the food a hot cast iron skillet.
8138,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Based on the food we had and their inability to even keep the stations stocked, we won't be returning."
8139,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Bad food:
Service: A-, the service was great."
8140,FOOD#NEGATIVE,They don't put out huge mounds of crab legs for the taking like some of the buffets I go to....not sure what's the deal with that.
8141,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Dry, cardboard textured fish, wet, over-dressed salads, soggy pizza, and what I would consider a lack of choice."
8142,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Corn beef hash w a tiny egg: very cute dish, almost a one biter but had no corn beef, just a tiny egg over potatoes."
8143,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Sushi station: 3\/5 - was ok, but the ratio of rice to meat was too high for my tastes."
8144,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Sushi selection was almost non-existent.
8145,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Hmmm yea dishes like the watermelon Siracha didn't really do it for me.
8146,FOOD#NEGATIVE,A green tea frappuccino is better tasting and 1\/3 of the price.
8147,FOOD#NEGATIVE,For dessert we were dreaming of mango and sticky rice..... None to be had.
8148,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The dinner selection seems very sparse in comparison to the brunch service.
8149,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The food is not so uniformly bad that it warrants a single star.
8150,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The flatbread pizza and fries seemed like things I can get back home at a chain restaurant.
8151,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Ambience: Though i wasn't really impressed with the food, this was probably one of the nicest restos i've ever seen!"
8152,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The food was not appetizing looking and did not taste good.
8153,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Food is like your ordinary buffet, salty and no flavor....nothing to be wowed at and for the price I could have gotten a surf and turf for cheaper and 10X better quality."
8154,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"My first Vegas meal was such a disappointment, I wouldn't of paid even $10 for this."
8155,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"I didnt see a ton of egg options, and they most of the lunch stations open (asian noodles\/soups, pizza, ect)."
8156,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"I think it is a little bit on the expensive side for the amount of food that you get, but then again it is in a major casino on the strip."
8157,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"NO sashimi, there were only small tiny rolls-not even REAL rolls...more like Kappa Maki with overly soggy rice used."
8158,FOOD#NEGATIVE,There is no crab legs for lunch during weekdays... even the Asian selection is pathetic compared to other $30 Vegas buffets.
8159,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The waitress tells me that I can not get cheese.
8160,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"My husband was a bit disappointed in the breakfast sandwich, he felt it was to small but tasted good."
8161,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The crab legs and shrimp both tasted fishy and the crab legs had ice crystals in the meat, the first prime rib roast they had out was massively overcooked and dry (even the center cuts), the second was done nicely, but they cut the most ridiculously thin slices."
8162,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"For $50, I think I am entitled to pile my plate if I choose, but management came around and literally limited the quantity of meats per person."
8163,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Seriously, a majority of the dishes that had sauce on them already had an ugly, old, crusty or filmy look and texture around 6:30PM."
8164,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Anyway, we got seated at 2PM and there was a limited numbers of breakfast foods available still even though we had an hour."
8165,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"At Wicked Spoon Buffet, I reached the end of the food counter with only one plate in my hands."
8166,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"It doesn't have the flash, design, or variety of the Buffet at the Wynn or Bacchanal."
8167,FOOD#NEGATIVE,They only had the cold version (I heard some buffets have both hot and cold?)
8168,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Sushi selection is small like something from a grocery store.
8169,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Pricey veryyyy pricey food should be warmer more hot seafood would be appreciative the waiters was extremely nice
8170,FOOD#NEGATIVE,The prices on some of the dishes are a bit overpriced and small in portion size.
8171,FOOD#NEGATIVE,Perhaps it's that the serving size (the burger) was so much smaller than what you can get in the same price range at other full service restaurants...or that I was expecting something about the meal to be more over the top.
8172,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Both items aren't very adventurous, but compared to bacon and eggs..."
8173,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"(+2*)
          My order: fish and crisp sandwich - considering that I'm a pescatarian, this was my only option."
8174,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Las Vegas is renowned for their world-class food, and this place isn't it, people."
8175,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The only bad thing I have to say about Wicked Spoon is that I did not take the time time to try it earlier - what was I thinking  - 
The food was was  excellent 
Service was amazing 
Never thought a buffet could match the service and food quality  of a upscale restaurant - Wicked Spoon has surpassed that expectation 
We will be back again and again"
8176,FOOD#NEGATIVE,If you want better food for a synonymous price go to the Wolfgang Puck cafe at the MGM.
8177,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"No line for the Asian hot foods, and it tasted like Panda Express."
8178,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"This buffet is better than the wynn buffet (no more rack of lamb, and lack of creativity) and currently the best right now."
8179,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,A buffet to die for.
8180,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Mon Ami Gabi is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.
8181,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Everything was great, but the service was a step down from the service that you would normally get at the original."
8182,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Hands down the BEST dessert buffet in Vegas.
8183,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I would say this buffet is at the top of my list for buffets in Vegas and I would definitely return.
8184,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I was referred by my brother (much more of a foodie than I) as he thought t was awesome, and I have heard from other friends (after the fact) that they loved this place too."
8185,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"It's not uncommon for a buffet to go downhill after it first opens, but after my first try, which in fact I was wonderfully amazed, I came back again and was equally happy with the results."
8186,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,You have to go here for dinner!
8187,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I normally hate buffets, but the Wynn managed to impress me."
8188,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Food was just good and worth the experience of ""go big or go home"" I personally wouldn't come back here for food but it's deff a place to check out."
8189,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I like this place a lot.
8190,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"We even came here TWICE for dinners during our trip, that is something considering how many restaurants available in Vegas!"
8191,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Amazing buffet.
8192,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I'll keep going here because I think it's one of the best all-round restaurants on the strip....but I'd go a lot more if the she-devils weren't waiting to shred me and everyone else once we arrive.
8193,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The only negative comment would be the wait (1.5 hour )and waiting area (small)
8194,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"My boyfriend reserved this place for my birthday, and it was really a good choice!"
8195,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place really is as good as the reviews say.
8196,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,definitely my favorite buffet.
8197,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I would probably give this place 3 1\/2 stars if I could.
8198,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Overall, I had a good experience and a food induced coma."
8199,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I had to go back to this place while in Vegas, absolutely loved the food."
8200,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Compared to any other buffet I've been too, this one is at the top."
8201,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Can't recommend this restaurant high enough!
8202,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The buffet is clean and classy.
8203,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,One of the greatest buffets I've ever experienced in Vegas.
8204,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,My only complaint is with the ice water.
8205,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Obviously, this is where all the locals of Las Vegas go to get Thai food."
8206,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This buffet is expensive but definitely worth it if you're going to eat the expensive items.
8207,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"It's located in a dodgy strip-mall consisting of massage parlors and shady looking bars, restaurants and all the riff -raff they attract but I'll gladly dodge a few bullets to eat here again."
8208,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Had an amazing experience here last week  with seven other girls.
8209,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I'd prefer this over a typical Vegas buffet ANYDAY!
8210,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is a solid restaurant on the Vegas Strip.
8211,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"In the end, The Buffet at Bellagio is the best, and the most simplest buffet that my parents and I are satisfying a great Labor Day brunch meal!"
8212,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I think it's one of the best buffet I had ever tried.
8213,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Awesome high end buffet.
8214,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,An oasis of real food amongst the buffet lines and crap overpriced food on the strip.
8215,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"The usual high end buffet stuff like prime rib, crab legs, sashimi, dim sum, etc."
8216,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Try this place out, I swear you'll keep coming back over and over again."
8217,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The only thing keeping me from giving this place 5 stars is that it REEKS  of cigarrette smoke.
8218,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I only hope Bacchanal can keep up it's gold standard for as long it can, as we all know how the restaurant industry can take a nose dive the moment it opens."
8219,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"o i absolutely hate buffet, yet i tried almost every buffet in las vegas and nothing parallels to the bellagio one yet."
8220,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Anyway this place is a pretty good Thai restaurant and I will be back!
8221,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The special price of $48 per person was well worth it.
8222,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This mighty establishment has made a fine addition to our meals at all hours around the clock.
8223,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The buffet was awesome!
8224,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I would definitely return to Serendipity and try other things on their menu.
8225,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"But, that's because it's a great restaurant worth waiting for."
8226,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is really the best buffet on the strip.
8227,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I will surely return to try other offerings here!
8228,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"To me Vegas is all about gambling, glitter, lasers, lights, music, and of course the infamous Earl of Sandwich!"
8229,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Hands down nothing beats the Bellagio in quality except maybe the Wynn.
8230,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"And especially if you're drunk, hungover, stoned, sober, or hungry, this is the spot for you!"
8231,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,My new fav buffet in Vegas great selection of sea food!
8232,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Best buffet on the strip hands down.. prime rib, crab legs, cornish game hen,and their small desserts are amazing."
8233,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Finally, I found a place in Vegas that is a decent substitute for a hoagie from the Northeast."
8234,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Will have to come back and try out dinner service!
8235,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Hands down may not be the trendiest place in Vegas but it's definitely hands down a top of the list restaurants that you won't be disappointed.
8236,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"For a place that feeds non-stop all day, at mass production, for 60+ people at a time, that are getting 3\/4 helpings each... this place is great."
8237,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,One of the best buffets I've eaten at yet!
8238,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is one of the very few buffets where I was actually excited about the food.
8239,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"So despite the crappy service that we received from our waitress (going to contribute it to being holiday season and her having to work an entire section to herself), this is the best buffet that I've had in Vegas and I've been to a lot of them."
8240,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is definitely a MUST GO buffet!
8241,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place is seriously out of this world.
8242,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"While I don't make my way down to the strip very often, I will if it means I get access to one of my favorite buffets or someone is taking me to a free show."
8243,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"But like everything at the Wynn, their buffet exceeded any I had ever been to."
8244,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"But yes guys, you have to try this place!"
8245,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I do want to note that on my first visit, I felt very underwhelmed because of all the hype and reviews."
8246,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This by itself made the buffet price worthwhile.
8247,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I plan on going again the next time I visit Vegas.
8248,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Bellagio used to be my favorite but I think Bacchanal has surpassed it.
8249,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Totally worth the wait at the restaurant!!
8250,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"We expected lamb chops and prime rib but not the Mexican pozole, taco station and the chile verde which were all excellent."
8251,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Last night we went to Del Monaco's, And they should be ashamed of themselves not even 1% of Mon Ami Gabi."
8252,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is definitely a place to experience...just dont think about the price & have a good time!
8253,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Best buffet I've been to hands down!
8254,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Anyway, now I realize that no Vegas trip is complete without a stop here."
8255,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,My definition of ZE BEST Thai restaurant in Vegas!
8256,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I'm never impressed by quantity over quality but I really wanted to like this place.
8257,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Bellagio, Wynn, and Paris were previous greats for me, but they don't even come to mind when I think of Vegas buffet options anymore."
8258,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place blows subway away in terms of quality and tastiness.
8259,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Soooooo good and I don't even like buffets.
8260,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Went here for lunch one afternoon and had had the greatest man sandwich...........steak.egg.bacon and cheese on a roll.......find it and order it!!!!!
8261,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Overall a classy buffet that is sure to please even those put off by buffets in general.
8262,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,People had warned us that you can't get a bad meal in Vegas and honestly we found this to be true!
8263,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I am looking forward to my next visit.
8264,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Now I know why Wynn has one of the best buffets in town.
8265,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I couldn't recommend this restaurant more highly.
8266,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I can't wait to go back to Vegas and eat here again.
8267,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It was the best buffet I have ever eaten at!
8268,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Food: 5\/5

8273,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"This was the first trip I took to Vegas in which I was celebrating a birthday for someone who means a whole lot to me (my boyfriend) and ""going HAM"" wasn't exactly the entire itinerary... since I know very little about Vegas eateries because all I do is party when I go to Vegas, I did the only thing I know to do in such situations...I Yelp'd... and found this lovely place in Paris."
8274,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Definitely will visit again and one is recommend is a must eat (for breakfast food at least)

8284,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Overall good experience, except for their lame excuses."
8285,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Warning: I wouldn't have enjoyed their buffet as much if I had to wait in line for 3 hrs to get in and also wait in line everytime I wanted to grab a plate of food.
8286,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"If you want a taste of celebrity chef food with a price anyone can afford, I'd highly recommend this place."
8287,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Easily the best meal I've ever had in Vegas!
8288,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"We paid $34\/person, kinda pricey... at least compared to all the other buffet in town, but it's definitely worth the money."

8303,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I'm not a huge fan of buffets because I can't eat that much... however after going to The Buffet at the Wynn Las Vegas, I really wish I could eat more than a plate of food so I could have tried everything out!"
8304,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I've been to my share of Vegas buffets on and off The Strip and I still prefer coming here over going to the newer and more expensive Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's Palace.
8305,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"In my opinion, it's a great quality buffet!"
8306,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,A note to all everything is ala carte which means Burger don't come with fries and you pay for what you get it's a upscale restaurant but worth trying.
8307,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Other than that place was pretty neat.
8308,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Look no further Mon Ami Gabi is the place for a great morning start  recharge for Vegas.
8309,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,As befitting a Vegas buffet.
8310,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,At the better end of Vegas buffet offerings.
8311,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,i love the Wynn buffet!
8312,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"My biggest quandary with this place is whether I'm going to be going back there by myself in October when I'm in Vegas again, or if I have to drag my cousins along....  

Oh Hash House, you go-go with the yummy food!"
8313,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,An added bonus is that this location is open 24 hours!
8314,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I don't understand any ratings less than 5 stars... ""The wait was to long"" really??"
8315,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Overall, we had an awesome experience!"
8316,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,If you're a fan of Gordan Ramsay I say the place is a must.
8317,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The fabulous view really made it a romantic and special night and this place was pretty affordable compared to most places on the strip.
8318,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I left one bite so it could earn the other dishes I would be back ;)
8319,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Hands down the best Thai, nay the best oriental, food I've ever had (and I'm oriental)."

8321,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Hands down the best buffet in Vegas!
8322,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Wish there were some Earl of Sandwiches in Orange County....since there is already one at Downtown Disney at Disneyworld, why not make one at Downtown Disney at Disneyland?"
8323,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The hotel had a reputation of being Vegas's classic hotels and the buffet doesn't stray far from that image as well.
8324,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is my go-to spot for authentic Thai food and I am utterly in love.
8325,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place makes a Las Vegas trip complete!
8326,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Thank you for an exquisite dinner.
8327,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,We loved the buffet.
8328,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It was really  great personal service that we didn't really expect from a buffet - but I would definitely come back for the service and the food.
8329,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I recommed this place, you wont be let down!"
8330,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I cannot handle buffets because I get full so quickly but this place was good.
8331,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"The food is delicious, probably the best buffet in Vegas."
8332,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Imo, the best buffet in town."
8333,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is my new go to place whenever I find myself in Vegas.
8334,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Good quality omelettes, strong coffee, everything under control."
8335,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,But that definitely wouldn't deter me from going back when in Vegas.
8336,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"One of the better buffets in Vegas, I can't say its the best buffet because i haven't been to them all..."
8337,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"It's still 6 bucks for a sandwich that's not real big, but at least it's good."
8338,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Definitely one of the better buffets to check out on the strip.
8339,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I've made it my life's goal to try every buffet in Las Vegas, and this buffet makes all the other LV buffets that I have tried seem like 1 star places!"
8340,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This was a fun restaurant to visit!
8341,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"SO GOOD)
Raspberry rice krispy treat
Pistachio chocolate cake 
Oreo chocolate dipped strawberry

Please check this buffet out if you are visiting Vegas!"
8342,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"It beats every place in both cali and nevada 
The staff is friendly and efficient."
8343,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It's my one meal a day in sin city.
8344,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,First time we have found a restaurant that tastes VERY close to our favorite place at home.
8345,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Like everything else at the Cosmo, this buffet is top notch."
8346,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Other than the awkward, mysterious, FAR walk to the buffet, it was just awesome."
8347,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,We love the Wynn Buffet and will continue to be excited to revisit many more times in the near future.
8348,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Lovely experience.
8349,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It was great and actually spicy:) definitely will come back next time I'm in Vegas.
8350,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place sets the bar!
8351,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,My family is very discriminating when it comes to food - and my Father especially - who loves this place and eats here every time he comes to Vegas.
8352,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Hash House is definitely a place to seek out and savor!
8353,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Of course, one should always make room or at least try the different cuisines prepared at buffets in general.....at least that's how I view dining at a buffet."
8354,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place is open 24 hours so definitely could see this as a great after party choice or hungover breakfast spot.
8355,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It was almost 11 when we saw this cool burger joint with a fire-lit sign.
8356,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Also, every item of food sounds like something that could be on a menu at a nice restaurant."
8357,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,We are buffet goers - and  we love a good buffet.
8358,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Best Thai in the world !!!
8359,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is definitely one of the good ones.
8360,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Next time it'll be more :)

Now, the BEST part of the buffet is the DESSERT!!"
8361,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Not cheap, but well worth the quality food, good service and magnificent view"
8362,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Everything was good and could'nt find a glaring misstep, sure some things are better than others but overall this buffet was awesome."
8363,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Every time I'm in Vegas I make it a point to eat at Gordon Ramsay BRGR at least once...twice, maybe even three times...it's THAT good!!!"
8364,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I have ate here a couple times and it's oh so good and nice change of pace in Vegas.
8365,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,hands down - BEST buffet in Vegas!
8366,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"The selections, the quality of the food, the service, it was fantastic and the price of about $22 is in line with any other breakfast buffet in town."
8367,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is perfectly fine and is the standard for every restaurant I've dined at.
8368,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"It was hard to find, but all the best places are hidden gems am I right?"
8369,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I know it's not cool to admit it, but there is something about a place that has so many different kinds of food in so much abundance that appeals to me."
8370,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"So next time you're at the strip and in the mood to eat like an emperor or just needing something super heavy and plentiful to soak up the booze from last night, look no further than the Bacchanal Buffet."
8371,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"In my opinion, Bacchanal Buffet is more comparable to Wicked Spoon, but still better."
8372,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is why I love this place.
8373,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I give this place 5 stars not for the food or the drinks although they were delicious but because of Daisy the bartender.
8374,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"It was a good choice, they were awesome!"
8375,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is a key must have during any trip to vegas.
8376,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Great place.
8377,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I love love love this place~
8378,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,A must have if you're in Vegas.
8379,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"CONS (way less cons than pros, so let's start here):
- there is always a line."
8380,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"and for the overpriced vegas food, this is a pleasant surprise."
8381,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place was more than I expected.
8382,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Overall everyone loved the food and had a nice experience.
8383,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Bacchanal is the best, but it comes with a pretty hefty price tag and a usually long wait in line."
8384,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It's soooo worth it!
8385,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"It was after 12am when we ate here, so the next time I'm in Vegas and hungry late, I will very likely come by here."
8386,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It's a nice restaurant indeed!
8387,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Mon Ami Gabi is one of my favorite spots to have brunch in Vegas, sitting on the outdoor patio overlooking the strip with the Eiffel Tower behind me, enjoying delicious French food!"
8388,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This was a perfect spot because we didn't feel any mugginess.
8389,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Go to Bacchanal Buffet, it's a lot more worth it, especially considering the price range."
8390,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Burgr is definitely a restaurant you want to try when your on the Vegas strip!
8391,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Definitely ask for a second round (they give you a free baguette before you order as an app) of the baguette to sop up the sauce.
8392,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"On an impromptu trip to Las Vegas before the holiday weekend to officially kick off summer, I had to stop by and try this highly recommended French restaurant in the Paris hotel on the strip."
8393,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Didn't have to wait long to sit outside (great view of the strip) and everyone left completely satisfied.
8394,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"You would be surprised to find out that you could find a good restaurant like this one with an ""ok"" price."
8395,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,One of my favorite lunch\/brunch places when coming to Las Vegas.
8396,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,probably one of the best buffets i have been to.
8397,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Overall its a good place, NOT the best in my opinion but id definitely come back for a light lunch or brunch."
8398,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Definitely worth checking out as the best buffet option in Vegas!
8399,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"This is definitely a place to try, but I think once is enough."
8400,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This was the most that I've ever paid for a buffet and it was well worth it.
8401,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Each and every part of our experience was fantastic.
8402,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Overall, the experience, ambiance, and food was pretty good."
8403,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I will make this a stop I make every time I am in Vegas.
8404,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I saw a review that it was weak but I ordered it anyways and it was far from it!
8405,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Excellent thai food in a out of the way strip mall.
8406,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,We had a party of 9 sit down so they seated us in this private area with 2 tables that seats 12 people each.
8407,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,If you like home town buffet and it's your 65th high school reunion then I recommend this place to you.
8408,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"So I would probably come back to nosh on some grub, but as for the frozen hot chocolate that Oprah swore by, I would kick myself if I order it again!!"
8409,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I was not disappointed with this buffet!
8410,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It was what I expected and it was exactly what a buffet is to me.
8411,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The prices were fair and the food is one of the best you can find on the Strip for the prices especially because it's so well made and tasty.
8412,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"With that being said, there are a limited number of things that make this place stand out."
8413,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Not going to write too much because i wasnt really satisfied with this buffet.
8414,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,We Love Lotus of Siam and will keep coming back!
8415,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"It definitely hit the spot, as in, when you don't know what to eat and feel like being adventurous and finding a hidden gem."
8416,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The decor and lighting in the area was great (just like the rest of the hotel) and the overall taste of the food was satisfying.
8417,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I liked the experience.
8418,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I have been to all of the major buffets in town (save the M Resort), and this is the best."
8419,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The Buffet was GREAT AS USUAL.
8420,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"located in planet hollywood, this lunch time hot sandwhich was super delish carribean jerk chicken, peppers, cheese an chicken and a special mayo sauce, just enought to fill you up."
8421,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Thank you for the great experience.
8422,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Price is high, its a bit cramped at times and there is a horde of tourists outside, but a fun place to say you've gone to."
8423,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It hit the spot.
8424,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"After asking my friends for a recommendation of where to eat, many suggest Bacchanal and I am SO glad that my group and I settled for Bacchanal."
8425,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This might be my new favorite thai joint.
8426,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I would come back here if I was in the mood for a more upscale buffet taste.
8427,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Come for the food but take the time to break away from the pace of Vegas and enjoy this gem.
8428,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place is worth the wait.
8429,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place was excellent!!
8430,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I'd venture to say this was my best meal on this trip, factoring in taste and cost - not bad for a sandwich shop!"
8431,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Trick: come at the end of brunch, so you pay for brunch prices but get to taste both brunch and dinner food!"
8432,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I would definitely go back here again....good food, good service, good view and good friends."
8433,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"We had ate at the Bellagio for breakfast, and to be completely honest with you, I would rather pay 35 bucks to eat breakfast at the bellagio buffet rather than waste it at the wynn!!!"
8434,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"If it was about 7 bucks less, I would have absolutely no complaints about this buffet!"
8435,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Definitely gonna go back next time in Vegas!
8436,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"If you're a californian visiting vegas, please drop by this joint for some good wholesome thai food."
8437,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"seriously, if they had more locations...subway, quizno's, etc would become endangered species."
8438,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"As long as I have the time and money for it, Bacchanal is my go-to for buffets!"
8439,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Its a bit pricey for a Vegas Breakfast but worth it.
8440,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"because each course is served in its individual dishes; portioned just right for the tasting

2) a beautiful place in a sassy hotel and casino

3) easy to get to meaning you don't have to search for it."
8441,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Definitely worth the 2 mile trip off the Strip for great quality That cuisine.
8442,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Its reputation is well earned.
8443,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is currently my fav buffet in Vegas.
8444,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,My only regret is that we went to Earl of Sandwich on our last day in Vegas and I couldn't return for another sandwich.
8445,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I'm pretty sure I've ordered the same thing, The Full Montagu, all 3 times I've been to EoS, but why mess with something good?"
8446,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"To make the most of your Vegas experience and somehow save some money during the day so you can obviously spend twice as much at night, the Buffet at the Bellagio is the answer."
8447,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,House Hashes are my go to!!
8448,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I also like to come here for the buffet lunch with a friend.
8449,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Food is ok but I liked the place, very large 2 dining rooms and don't feel like the traditional Thai restaurant."
8450,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"i just went there with my friends 2 weeks ago.....for me i give 4 stars i like it i love foods i love survice....you can ask whatever you want i mean like soda,tes,water whenever you want it......we were so enjoy ,talk,eat,we spent time there like 3. hours hehehe"
8451,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"The Buffet begins with a ridiculously long waiting line, which until now, I don't understand the hype behind it."
8452,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I think you can skip it if you've had good Thai food before.
8453,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"My all-time favorite buffet in Vegas, hands down."
8454,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Nothing to complain and meets my expectation of a buffet this price range.
8455,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Use to go to the Wynn Buffet
Now I am going both
I woudn't be able to choose which one is the best
Food is excellent and various
LOVE IT"
8456,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Great place for sandwiches on the strip, affordable too for Vegas!"
8457,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Like other places, they got almost everything, but Bacchanal has legit everything."
8458,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,NOW I understand what the raves are about.
8459,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Don't worry Gordon we will be back.
8460,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"The reviews seem to indicate that Wicked Spoon has gone downhill in the past few years, so all I have to say about that is I wish I were here when it was ""great"" because it's certainly pretty darn good now."
8461,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It is a hidden gem because it isn't in the best of areas or plazas in Las Vegas.
8462,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,You also can't eat fast food everyday so Earl of Sandwich if your best bet on the strip.
8463,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Its a must for the experience an everytime i go to vegas i will go.
8464,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I dont know why they serve breakfast cereals at a buffet like this.
8465,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Overall I enjoyed Serendipity 3.
8466,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I closed my eyes, bowed my head, and thanked God for letting me experience this moment."
8467,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"But because the food is so good, you get past the complete lack of service... not sure why their are a few haters out there but I am fairly well traveled and found the food to be pretty exceptional, particularly for the price.... the only thing we did not love were the desserts... not very good...

...but the rest of the buffet items, both breakfast and dinner, where fantastic!"
8468,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"For starters this is currently the ""#1 buffet"" in Vegas and its advertised everywhere you go in Vegas thus making it extremely popular."
8469,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Can't wait to visit it again in November.
8470,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,We're going back next time Vegas and I'd recommend you check it out too.
8471,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"First and foremost, THANK YOU to Yelpers Michelle ""Shell"" B. and Bubba N. for suggesting this place to me!"
8472,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Very, very good quality."
8473,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Thank you Gordon Ramsey for opening a great place for us regular folks who appreciate good  american food.
8474,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Service was not speedy but didn't deter a great time.
8475,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Definitely a good place to try if you're looking for a fancy burger place on the strip.
8476,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place is the best spot for breakfast we tried.
8477,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I think it's an experience and you have to go here if you haven't.
8478,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is one of the better Thai restaurants I've dined at here in Vegas.
8479,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It make you forget that you are in a Vegas Casino restaurant.
8480,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Here is the down low ...
-Place is massive,  well decorated, and welcoming
-The price caught us a bit off guard (then again, we are in Las Vegas, and dining in one of Ramsay's joint ... but after late dindin, we agreed it was well worth it!"
8481,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Hands down, best Vegas buffet I've been to and made me want to relive my eat til I drop days."
8482,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The 5 Star rating speaks more the to wonderful time (including the food and service) and over-all experience rather than just the food.
8483,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is definitely an upper level buffet among standard ones.
8484,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Worth every penny!!
8485,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"This time, me and my companions opted for The Buffet brunch, and were not disappointed!"
8486,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I don't know if the U.S. is lacking in good Thai restaurants but this place for me was just 'good' despite previously being told by my American friends that this place is amazing\/delicious\/fantastic...

Half of us ordered chicken pad thai and the other half of us ordered green or yellow chicken thai curry."
8487,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I love this restaurant!!
8488,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Tried it because of all the good reviews, and I wasn't disappointed."
8489,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,My wife is so pissed that she actually told me to write this or sleep on the floor.
8490,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Every trip was completely worth the bill.
8491,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Good for a sandwich chain.
8492,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"That is quite a recommendation, considering I am part Thai, my father was a Thai chef, and I travel all over Thailand frequently eating my way through the country :-)

It is crazy what you find in a nondescript strip mall off the Strip."
8493,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It has all the good qualities that GR always beats on in Kitchen Nightmares.
8494,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Back home, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant but in Vegas it is the Americana version of classic French Bistro without breaking the bank."
8495,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,im absolutely blown away by this buffet.
8496,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It was so good that my husband and I had lunch at BurGR two days in a row during our short stay in Vegas.
8497,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I look forward to dinner here every time I go to Vegas.
8498,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I'm not a huge fan of buffets but if you going to have a buffet in Vegas, this is the one you want."
8499,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"We went here for dinner and it was great, the service was spectacular as was the meal and appetizers."
8500,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Unlike the last time I went to San Diego location I had no regrets.
8501,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"The outside looks like it's a subpar restaurant, but when you walk in, you'll be surprised, or at least I was."
8502,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is my fave restaurant in Vegas.
8503,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I don't usually give 4 stars for a buffet because generally the food tastes the same no matter where I go, especially in Vegas."
8504,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The best Thai food in Vegas... baby!
8505,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"That said, this is the most extraordinary, creative, and quite simply overwhelming buffet Las Vegas has ever built."
8506,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Let me just say that I have never paid $40 for AYCE buffet but it was SO worth it!
8507,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is still my kind of buffet.
8508,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,THE best buffet in Vegas!
8509,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"THE FOOD:
Just about everything was good... All of the breakfast items were great."
8510,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It was like tapas style which was fun.
8511,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"This place is worth checking out, and you can find BoGo coupons (we got several coupons for Wicked Spoon and other places at the Cosmopolitan from our United flight)."
8512,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is a vegas staple that deserves all their good reviews!
8513,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Definitely the best meal I had in Las Vegas 
Environment-my uncle said the environment was what he has been looking for for 10 years."
8514,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Service could be faster since it wasn't a full house but oh well, we were on vacation."
8515,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I stopped by here during my spring break and it was more memorable than any buffet I went to.
8516,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Everything was pretty high quality, unlike a usual buffet."
8517,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Now, knowing that this establishment is owned by Gordon Ramsay we expected to pay a few extra bucks but ultimately decided to just share our food because we were hungry, not starving."
8518,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I used to say that I can't come to vegas without putting a SINGLE bet on something...but now I gotta say I can't come to vegas without eating at Bacchanal!
8519,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I also love the way the system works ... order your sandwich, then pick up any sides, desserts, drinks, etc."
8520,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"No one rushed me and I was able to just able to take my time and enjoy the evening, I wouldn't make this a regular place because of the price, but special occasions will see me back there."
8521,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It's like a fine dinning buffet.
8522,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"While other buffets seem to be going downhill (all while charging hefty fees), Wynn does not disappoint."
8523,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I come here more for the experience then the food.
8524,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Cool thing #3: If you go in during lunch hours, you can stay until dinner hour hits (at 3pm)!"
8525,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"If you're trying to decide between here and the Bellagio, this place (Wicked Spoon) is much better in my opinion."
8526,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Overall: A great place for a quick lunch or snack.
8527,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place is amazing open 24hrs and with the portions they give you might need every bit of 24hrs to finish your food.
8528,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It is a wonderful experience for your eyes and your stomach.
8529,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"for the sgv people..yes it is better than ralphs gourmet, claros, lee, mr baguette and tip top sandwiches!"
8530,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is one of those meals and experiences that I'm still thinking about because it was that good.
8531,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I am a Vegas local and this is my favorite strip restaurant and one of my favorites in town.
8532,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,As I sat comfortably into my seat I couldn't help but notice this dainty young lady was eating from two giant platters of food.
8533,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Love the food and the place.
8534,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"none of that shitty greasy, hate yourself in the morning (well maybe a little of that) factor you find at most buffets."
8535,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The two stars are for the restaurant I give the waitress 5 stars for taking my cold burger back and making sure it was hot the second time around .
8536,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"One of my top favorite Resturant, i love their French food."
8537,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Yes, they place is brand new and they need to work on the kinks and minor flaws but all in very good concept that improves upon the age buffet."
8538,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,High end quality!
8539,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Among all the places I've eaten at it Vegas, this is always really consistently great, and when you mix in the outdoor patio experience - it's one of my favorites."
8540,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Out of all the buffets we tried the week we were in Sin City I would hands down rank Wicked Spoon the very best.
8541,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"In my opinion, the Serendipity 3 in Vegas relies on the draw of their name and offers little more than an average dining experience on the Strip."
8542,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,We stayed at the planet hollywood towers and you can bet that this was our go to late night spots.
8543,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,We had a great experience and enjoyed our moment here!
8544,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The one reason I can't give them 5 stars is because they lack the variety that other buffets have.
8545,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Simply beautiful experience.
8546,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I loved it!
8547,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"As far as buffets goes, this is the best I have ever experienced."
8548,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Slightly more expensive than Wicked Spoon but making up the difference in complimentary champagne there are things to love about both of Las Vegas' premier all-you-can-eat experiences yet aside from a more expansive gelato case and my predilection to The Cosmopolitan's soundtrack I'd be hard-pressed to ever recommend it over Bacchanal.
8549,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I have been here half a dozen times and the only complaint i have is that the restaurant was short staffed twice when we went, causing a long wait at the bar even though we were the only ones sitting at it."
8550,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Yeah, this is pretty much the best buffet in Vegas."
8551,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Location\/Ambience\/Energy\/Service\/Food=Yes!!!
8552,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"After checking in to the room at Wynn, my buddy and I were given with a pair of complimentary admission to either breakfast or lunch at this place (we had a special deal)."
8553,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone, especially those needing a gluten free menu."
8554,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Let's just say this place is pretty amazing!
8555,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Insanely delicious buffet for the price!
8556,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,A better than average buffet.
8557,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Rachel Ray also recommends this buffet.
8558,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The restaurant was awesome.
8559,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,HH is a place you go out of your way to get to enjoy.
8560,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Definitely recommend this place.
8561,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The Good - The restaurant is very nice and the staff (and their small uniforms) is beautiful.
8562,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"If you're going to spend a good amount of money for a buffet, this is the place."
8563,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I really enjoyed the prime rib it had great flavor and  was better then most other buffets I have eaten at.
8564,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,What a great restaurant.
8565,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"That being said, I enjoyed myself and the restaurant but I don't think I will come back."
8566,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"They definitely have a long line of different foods, but if you are a seafood lover I don't recommend their seafood options."
8567,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Totally worth it not to eat at a buffet and eat here!
8568,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Wicked Spoon is one of our favorite buffets in vegas!
8569,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"The most famous buffet in Las Vegas, the Bacchanal buffet at Caesars Palace is delicious and filling, but pretty darn expensive."
8570,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Great brunch spot for mimosas, bloodies and a guaranteed good meal."
8571,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Paris' buffet is  way better and you get a whole day to stuff yo face in between those crab legs just like you did to that random when you got..crabs.
8572,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Definitely make a trip to Wicked Spoon if you're in Vegas!
8573,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Compared to other buffets it IS good don't get me wrong, but it not what it's hyped up to be and not worth the price."
8574,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Really great place to eat!
8575,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I would recommend this for lunch, anyone who wants a great lunch and doesn't want to risk paying $60 on a crappy buffet."
8576,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It wasn't my favorite but still good quality.
8577,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It's my favorite buffet!
8578,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Hands down the best all you can eat buffet in VEGAS!
8579,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is by far the best buffet in Las Vegas and I have tried a lot of them.
8580,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The stuff I liked- I ate plenty of.
8581,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Very good Sunday champagne brunch, but somehow not quite as impressive as I expected for $28.95, or based on its reputation."
8582,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,43 per person was worth it for lunch but we got lucky because at 3 dinner started so we got there at 2:30 and got to enjoy both!!!
8583,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Take it from me or not but I am Thai and have been to Thailand many times and I think I agree with the writer from Gourmet Magazine that this is ""The best Thai food in North America""."
8584,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place is obviously very popular and for good reason.
8585,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"For someone who thinks buffets are only ok, this buffet blew me away!!"
8586,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The Riesling was an absolute knockout and an astounding value at $38.
8587,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"The chef ramsay, great job of getting what the fans wanted a burger joint that is affordable."
8588,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"We came for an early dinner around 6:00pm and we timed it perfect was a short wait, however when we were leaving the line was all the way out into the casino."
8589,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"If you are going to try a buffet in Vegas, THIS is the one!"
8590,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,We finally understand why Bacchanal is considered the best buffet in Vegas.
8591,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Chef Ramsey did not disappoint.
8592,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,But Wicked Spoon in my opinion is very popular because the food keeps a nice level of quality and a few more items that wouldn't normally be seen at a buffet.
8593,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This was the best $7 I spent in Vegas.
8594,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,We were pleasantly surprised by the weekday breakfast buffet.
8595,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It is a must try place :) All servers are very friendly and quick to serve.
8596,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I will go back next time for dinner or champagne bunch for sure.
8597,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"If you only have time to hit up one buffet, this isn't a bad choice."
8598,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Best thing in Vegas.
8599,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The only reason why we didn't give it a 5 star rating is because the wait for the food was very long!
8600,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It's a good place to try if you've never been.
8601,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The best buffet for now.
8602,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Starting from every single breakfast entry to heavy ribs to delicate yet perfect deserts the suave looking buffet at the sex themed cosmopolitan is perfect for me.
8603,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I will keep coming back as long as they keep up the good work!!
8604,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Both are messy but so worth it!
8605,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Price is very affordable compared to most of the food joints in Vegas.. plus it's at a very convenient location.. found in Planet Hollywood on the strip.. and there's even a Sugar factory and Fat Tuesday near by :)
8606,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Always new and innovative stuff at Hash House A Go Go!
8607,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"If you are a foodie on the Las Vegas strip looking for a buffet, look no further than Wicked Spoon!"
8608,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is probably my #1 buffet now in vegas.
8609,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"If you're in vegas , you have to come to Burgr."
8610,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,My boyfriend and I were already loving it just from those two things.
8611,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,We will definitely return next time in Vegas.
8612,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"), dim sum and pho sections, chicken and waffles section

overall... one of my top 5 favorite buffets in vegas, but probably not my first choice."
8613,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Overall, still love coming here in the mornings to sit outside the patio for the view of Bellagio and the city center."
8614,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Prices are cheap, service is cool and the place is opened 24\/7...
How could you complain?"
8615,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is a great buffet with great service.
8616,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Me and the boyfriend came here for dinner on seriously empty bellies, and The Buffet did not disappoint."
8617,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"We ordered 4 burgers, 1 beer, sweet potato frieds, Parmesan fries and 2 shakes which was great."
8618,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Flavor wise its pretty close, I would like to say WS is slightly better but then it depends on what you eat."
8619,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Even after the endless hype from my friends, this place still delivered!"
8620,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,:) Must try this place!
8621,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Overall, Bacchanal Buffet is worth the price!"
8622,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I definitely will make a trip back to get it.
8623,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Heard this buffet was one of the top ten in Vegas.
8624,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I highly recommend this place to everyone in my family and to all my friends.
8625,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place is a solid four stars.
8626,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I wish they had a better estimated time of wait or I probably would've left and just had a regular dinner.
8627,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Caesars' Bacchanal Buffet is THE BEST BUFFET IN VEGAS (and perhaps the world based on the United Nations of diners eating or queued up in line waiting to get in)!
8628,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"""Good choice."
8629,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I think it's overrated but it's still something you should try!
8630,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Our only MINOR gripe was the potatoes were a bit bland, no big deal."
8631,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The best effin buffet ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
8632,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Open 24hrs for you late night eaters.
8633,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Since it so prominently featured Gordon Ramsay, I thought it would be a little cleaner."
8634,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is now my favorite buffet in Vegas.
8635,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"But if you are missing those Bangkok street vendors and want a taste of Thailand in North America, this is where you go."
8636,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Another go to spot for all my out of town guests in my home.
8637,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The sandwich shop located near the entrance of PH is a good place to get a bite.
8638,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Will still be returning to Wicked Spoon for my fave dishes, Bone Marrow, & better gelato."
8639,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Thus is probably the best Thai restaurant I have been to in the USA, and there have been overt a hundred."
8640,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Overall, a great choice in Vegas."
8641,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The restaurant was lovely and in general I liked the food.
8642,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I came in here twice over a 3 day period, and almost made it three times!"
8643,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Unlike a lot of other places in Vegas, Earl of Sandwich is a sure win!"
8644,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I had a great experience, so much so that my husband and I want to go back Saturday night to."
8645,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"My favorite Vegas buffet, for sure."
8646,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Because of his prestige, I knew this place must be amazing."
8647,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It ended up being the best buffet I have ever been to.
8648,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is the best buffet in Vegas.
8649,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,We could only eat so much until we hated ourselves but I can honestly say that it was good experience.
8650,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I an not a fan of Buffets but I have made the exception and eaten here at the Winn on a few occasions.
8651,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"In a city where even low quality deli sandwiches cost upwards of $10-12, Earl of Sandwich is a great find."
8652,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"After hearing so many good things about this place for years, we finally tried it."
8653,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is the ONLY spot that I'll make sure to hit every time i'm in town from now on.
8654,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I now see why this place has so many reviews and 4 stars!
8655,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I have been known to come here on multiple nights and skip some of the other trendy places for a good meal...it really is that GREAT!
8656,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Love the concept of the buffet!
8657,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Just very glad Bellagio gained our taste buds' confidence back after the disappointment at Aria's poor impression on not only ""so-called"" interior design, but also very bad service."
8658,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Preferred the buffet at the Wynn hands down.
8659,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"(Although he still smiles when he thinks of how bacon is INSIDE the waffles)

In the true spirit of Hash House, we washed down as much of our entrees as we could handle with a brown bagged 25 ounce can of the King of Beers and even walked out with those in hand after we paid our server, who did a really good job throughout our visit despite being really busy."
8660,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I like this buffet.
8661,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I say all in all worth a visit, especially if you like fancy burgers."
8662,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The experience is exciting and the food is actually good (compared to buffet food elsewhere).
8663,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"If its a nice visit like when we visited the restaurant, call ahead, make a reservation, and ask for patio seating."
8664,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Some fav's over Thanksgiving weekend:
- Butternut squash risotto
- pumpkin ravioli
- Oysters Rockefeller
- crab legs
- pumpkin pie


The crepe line was way too long, as was the wait too be seated, but otherwise, this place is still tops on my L.V."
8665,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place was a gem after all the horrible food we had in Las Vegas.
8666,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"This is my quick, go to lunch place on the strip."
8667,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,We will definitely go back on our next visit to Las Vegas.
8668,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Thank you so much, Mon Ami Gabi, for making this evening one that I'll never forget!"
8669,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This restaurant is amazing.
8670,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Beautiful presentation.
8671,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It's the best buffet in town for sure!
8672,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I've tried almost all of the buffets, and this is by far the best one out of them all."
8673,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I think the best buffet I've had in Vegas so far.
8674,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,As far as the buffets go on the strip I think this one is one of the better ones.
8675,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Bacchanal is definitely worthy of the title: ""Best Buffet On The Strip""
I've tried all the top buffets on the strip(Wynn, Bellagio, The M) but Bacchanal tops them all in every category."
8676,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This buffet was great for two reasons.
8677,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,If you're going to Las Vegas you must try Wicked Spoon!
8678,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"As for me I go back to Vegas in 18 days and I will probably eat at least 3 times there, the entire staff from the girls at the front, managers, servers, busser's, chefs are always incredible to me and any one I have brought there or told to dine there, even if you don't want a burger go for the desserts ;) till next time David Cagle"
8679,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This buffet was number one on my list to try!
8680,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"The Wynn is beautiful itself, but The Buffet is so pretty too."
8681,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"This place is always on those ""Top Vegas Buffets"" list and out of all the rest, this one is definitely the best."
8682,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Bacchanal is probably the pricest buffet on the strip, but for a reason, it has been voted the best buffet in Vegas, and there are a lot of buffets in Vegas."
8683,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Lotus of Siam has been called the ""best Thai restaurant in North America"", and I think it's warranted."
8684,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"This level of quality experience may be what sets this ""burger joint"" apart from all other ""burger joints"" in Vegas."
8685,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,overall a solid spot for dinner with a view.
8686,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,you would never guess that the best thai food in vegas is in some nondescript crappy strip mall a few miles off the strip but it is.
8687,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,But this was better.
8688,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is the best buffet I've ever been to in my life.
8689,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I'm not one to obsess over buffets, because I get entirely too full to truly qualify the food."
8690,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Lotus of Siam has made me a Pad See Ew snob, ever since that first time I ate here, the quality and technique that is executed here is so superb; I honestly have to remind myself that it's not supposed to be this good!"
8691,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Lunch here at the Bellagio isn't what I expected, I can't wait to come back and try their dinner as it seems and sounds remarkable!"
8692,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place nailed it all and what happened next was me devouring the entire burger.
8693,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I really enjoyed the Wynn Buffet!
8694,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I still think Caesars is better, but this buffet is still amazing."
8695,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I'm glad we went so we don't have to go back but if I had to do it again, I would have gone back to Joel Robuchon or if I wanted a buffet, to go the Wynn."
8696,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Absolutely lovely evening here, I will definitely return."
8697,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It was a very pleasant and relaxing dining experience where we were able to take our time and enjoy the moment.
8698,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Gordon Ramsay has the right to yell at other lesser chefs; Burgr proves it.
8699,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I couldn't move after this meal and I will never regret that moment.
8700,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Of course it is pricey but no worse that any others in buffett, but way way better"
8701,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Good eats, quality food and competitive pricing especially when compared to other buffets down the strip."
8702,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I would reccomend this place to Yelpers.This is the best review buffet in vegas.The sushi was great the service was great.Pizza tasted good and so did the fish.
8703,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"This time, we went to a weekday breakfast buffet ($20.99 pp) and despite lack of seafood (no crab nor shrimp on the Friday buffet) I enjoyed it immensely."
8704,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Okay, I would have gave this place 5 stars, if it wasn't for the hour wait... which I still don't understand because when we finally got inside, there were bunch of free tables!"
8705,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"The dinner buffet at the Bellagio is one of the best buffets in Vegas, hands down."
8706,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Not that is was bad by I guess I expected everything to be super flavorful and most items were simple mediocre.
8707,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Enjoyable experience!
8708,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It's worth trying while visiting Las Vegas.
8709,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,VERY CLEAN for a buffet!
8710,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,5 stars all the way.
8711,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Will return just to eat at this buffet.
8712,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Little did we know that we had hit the jackpot with our incredible timing!
8713,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"We keep trying to find nice romantic restaurants and it seems the party environment that Vegas is doesn't seem to allow for it...knowing that in advance, I'd still return to Mon Ami Gabi again."
8714,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Everything is so delicious here definitely my favorite buffet in Las Vegas.
8715,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is an excellent choice for a buffet if you are in the area.
8716,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Wonderful!
8717,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,this restaurant was fun!
8718,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is one of the better buffets I've been to in Vegas.
8719,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Overall, the buffet was good."
8720,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This was a great buffet.
8721,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I am never disappointed eating at Lotus.
8722,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I would recommend this buffet if you have lots of room and want to enjoy nice legs (crab legs that is, you can get the other kind at a different place in Vegas)."
8723,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"My first time at BurGR was so great, I had to go back the next day."
8724,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"In general, Wicked Spoon has pretty good deals for their meals... but def not as tasty as other buffets, but if you're budget conscious, this is a great buffet."
8725,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Expensive compared to others, but possilbly the best buffet Vegas."
8726,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Come here for one meal every time we come to Vegas.
8727,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Yup, still our fav buffet in vegas."
8728,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"The patio, the service, the coffee, the food...everything was on point."
8729,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The food overall is a bit salty but still my favorite buffet on the strip so I have to give it 5 stars!
8730,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,There were several other things I enjoyed that are not unique to Wicked Spoon.
8731,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,We had a great time and it made our wedding day even better.
8732,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Thanks Earl of Sandwiches, I will be back to try the Chipotle Chicken Avocado!"
8733,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,We wanted a casual meal reasonable costs and Hash House A Go Go delivered.
8734,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"The next time I come back, I think we'll just get the frozen hot chocolate."
8735,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It didn't feel like a typical buffet.
8736,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I have had a good amount of the buffets in Vegas and this one takes the cake!
8737,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is the best sandwich shop I ever ate in my life OMG!!!
8738,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Overall, it was a highly enjoyable experience."
8739,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"The price is expensive, but you get what you paid for, which is an awesome array of food at a way above average buffet."
8740,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place is going to always be on my list of food recommendations when in Vegas.
8741,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"It was a little pricey, but we had a good experience."
8742,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The absolute best buffet I've ever had in Vegas and probably my life.
8743,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"If you're a buffet fan, Bacchanal is a must ""try once in your life"" type of restaurant."
8744,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Last but no least, we ordered the shake #4, creme brulee pudding, oreo shake, oreo cookie...omg...this was awesome!!"
8745,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This has been my favorite buffet since they opened.
8746,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Favorite Buffet of all times.
8747,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Absolutely loved it as well as the pretty decor.
8748,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I think the Rio is still hands down better in the Harrah's family of amusement foods, but Caesars Palace does come a close 2nd."
8749,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"It is a little embarrassing, but I did have 6 servings of their prime rib and I don't regret one bite!"
8750,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"This is the most spectacular buffet I have been to, well worth the $35 I paid for brunch."
8751,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"All other foods (curry, noodles, pork belly) all put happy smiles on our face."
8752,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I don't like burgers at all, but I was willing to give this place a try and I was Not disappointed at all, to say the least."
8753,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I definitely would give this place a shot just to say you have been but I felt there breakfast and lunch menu could have been bigger and more diverse.
8754,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I've never tried anything else, and I probably never will because this sandwich is THE BEST!"
8755,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Really this place was just decent.

8837,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"There was something about the Bellagio buffet, even for lunch, that really made me take note."
8838,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"The Wicked Spoon, for 27 bucks at the time of writing, has dishes that include truffles, an improbable array of desserts and food variety that was so large, it catered for a group of differently fussy individuals, all of whom were satisfied."
8839,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I'm surprised to see all the bad reviews of this place.
8840,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The buffet was top tier.

8844,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"If you want it to, if you allow to, yes, this buffet can be the complete demise of a day in Vegas."
8845,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"However, this did not bother us because we were told to go to the bar and have a drink."
8846,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Dinner, Could be considered pricy but the food was unique and tasty enough to justify going."
8847,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I'm not much of a seafood fan but if you do enjoy seafood, I know that people just get plates and plates of crab legs, which definitely makes your meal worth it."
8848,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I don't think this buffet is worth waiting in line, so it's best for off-peak times."

8863,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"There is lots of great food and buffets in Vegas, but honestly there is NO buffet that even comes close to comparing to the quality and selection that you will find at ceasers palace buffet!"
8864,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I had it again this weekend and it confirmed my previous visit when I remembered it to be really good.
8865,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"The M and Bellagio are still my absolute favorites and if I do ever feel the desire to pay that much, that's where I'll head to."
8866,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I was told the buffet in Wynn or other places were the best, but no, this place IS the best."
8867,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It's no surprise the top chefs in the world come here when they visit Las Vegas .

8871,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,One of my very favorite restaurants!
8872,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This buffet is awesome!!
8873,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I've tried a few buffets in Vegas, and my favorite places are Hilton and Paris."
8874,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Only downside of the dinner was that we were sat in the furthest back table of the restaurant and the service was pretty slow.
8875,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Lotus of Siam is the kind of foodie heaven we all dream about.
8876,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,My favorite was my husband's profiteroles while the table liked the bananas foster.
8877,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I definately recommend coming to this place!
8878,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Overall I would give it an 8.5 out of 10.
8879,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,My friends and I left The Buffet very happy but needed a quick nap from the food coma.
8880,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Worth the splurge for the reigning buffet on the strip.
8881,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Yes they are more expensive, but the quality is honestly so worth it for what you get."
8882,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Pay the extra money, go to a nice sit down restaurant."
8883,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"ROASTED JALAPEÑO POPPERS - Cheddar bacon, cheddar ranch, one fiery surprise

I think Gordy was trying to showcase his Michelin 3 star plating techniques by serving each popper in its own shot glass."
8884,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I had high expectations for BurGR being that is one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, and they surpassed each and every expectation!"
8885,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Writing a review so I'll remember to come back here the next time I'm in town.
8886,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"When in Rome, or Vegas, I prefer to save my buffet days to a day when I feel it won't be as crowded so I haven't experienced a crowd much much but even if I had to, I'd wait here."
8887,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Simple but executed well.
8888,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is NOT a fast food experience by any means!
8889,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Service was quick, the price was A-OK, and you get a pretty darn good sandwich out of it all, so I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas!"
8890,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"For Vegas buffets, it's priced about the same as The Buffet at Wynn, with similar food and great atmosphere."
8891,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place was incredible.
8892,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I had my share of buffets from all over.
8893,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Definitely an experience I'm glad I had, but I gotta say the food was just average."
8894,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Our family loved this buffet.
8895,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It was worth the nearly $100 for 2 (weekend price) price tag compared to the other Vegas buffets we looked at.
8896,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I really enjoyed eating at this buffet.
8897,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Sampling only the breakfast options, Gabi aimed to please:  we have a dairy and gluten-allergic daughter, so we asked our friendly server, David, if the kitchen might accommodate a non-allergic waffle."
8898,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,but years later I still couldn't pass up trying this spot out!
8899,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I was over my meats quickly... my friend wasn't he had 3 servings (he really ate way more than what he paid for but let me tell you he can eat...) They have these things for your fingers to hold the hot dish.... so useful.
8900,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Cuisines across the world, prepared gourmet in front of you, never left out stale."

8902,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I finally had the pleasure of dining at a Gordon Ramsay establishment!
8903,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The overall experience was good or I would have to post a two star review.
8904,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The Yelp Elite in me naturally reached for this and began answering the questions like crazy :P I thought it was pretty cool how much they integrated the use of iPads and iPods at their restaurant!
8905,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I really really really wanted to like this place, especially seeing all the wonderful reviews and all the awards this place has gotten....but I just couldn't :(

The ambiance of the restaurant is alright, nothing fancy but the service is wonderful."
8906,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Agree with everyone on yelp; this is the only buffet you should go to on the strip.
8907,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"My girlfriend and I were both skeptical about any kind of Vegas buffet, but this one blew us both away."
8908,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,After club spot to go to (other than pho).

8923,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The price of a sandwich isn't all that bad and the sandwich itself is ok(depends on what you get).
8924,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,There wasn't anything at the buffet I didn't like.
8925,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Only downside is restrooms are downstairs in the casino.
8926,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Overall, it's probably one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas."
8927,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Best Breakfast \/ Lunch buffet in Las Vegas.
8928,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Excellent quality and great service.
8929,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Go when they first open,very busy every nite.The drunken shrimp is a must."
8930,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I would hasten to add that as far buffets go it was really good; as good or better than Bellagio's.
8931,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Honestly the best buffet I have had ever!
8932,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I am not a buffet lover, but you can't go wrong with the buffet at Bacchanal."

8938,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Overall, part of the overindulgent experience of Las Vegas."
8939,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"this is a very well amazing place, the ONLY PROBLEM is the wait
be advise.."
8940,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I would recommend this buffet.
8941,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Nothing tasted (or looked) like it belonged on a buffet, and we barely scratched the surface of what this place had to offer."
8942,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,All the cab drivers know how to good to it and it was easy getting a cab back to the strip.
8943,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"This is the kind of place you give into the food, throw out your calorie counting habit, and just enjoy all that is in the creations of Earl of Sandwich."
8944,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Best affordable food in Vegas!
8945,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The word is out and people Love the Earl.
8946,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,There have even been days where my lunch AND dinner have been from this place.
8947,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Now we know why this place was packed!
8948,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Plus the heater wasn't working :[

We ordered the ABC burger [$16.50] with Sweet Potato Fries and frozen hot chocolate and split the meal which was perfect!"
8949,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Gordon Ramsey I am scared of you, but I will continue to eat at your place and gulp down your food."
8950,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"To me this is the best option because it's cheaper than most buffets are for lunch, but includes more foods and options."
8951,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,One of the best Thai places we've eaten at outside of Thailand for sure.
8952,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I was mildly disappointed that they didn't have raw oysters or a better selection of sushi, but their other dishes made up for it."
8953,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"It's like a high end restaurant and elegant dining experience, at least again as far as buffets are concerned."
8954,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place has become one of our buffet stops.
8955,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I stopped by here twice within 6 hours, both for dinner and for a late night snack."
8956,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,If you're looking for a hearty meal on the cheap definitely come here!
8957,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"There was very little to complain about except for the price, but I don't review based on price."
8958,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I'm sure this will be the only buffet we go to in Vegas now; Wicked Spoon has spoiled us too much!
8959,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It was still a good experience though.
8960,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Reviews of this place was great and it didn't disappoint.
8961,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It is by far the best breakfast restaurant in Las Vegas!
8962,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I must say it's a damn good place for romantic dinners..the ambiance is quite classy and beautiful..the waiters were very friendly......the french onion soup and the scallops entree were good...........the only minimal complaint i have is it's a bit pricey...........we finished off with a White Chocolate Bread pudding dessert which topped all the items of our dinner....I sure recommend this place for romantic dinners at least :)
8963,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I heart Hash House A-Go-Go.
8964,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Yes I truly became a regular customer.
8965,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,They were just as good as the ones at the restaurants too.
8966,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"-great and clean presentation at all stations
-confusing layout
-all food was fresh
-slow service possibly due to business flow

All in all probably the best value and quality buffet on the strip."
8967,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I'm not really a buffet person in general since I hate feeling super full, but one of the better places to do it is at Bacchanal."
8968,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,They will be trying this place out now :) I will be back as well.
8969,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Sandwiches here are about $7 and although it makes a good late night snack, it's nothing I would schedule in my Vegas food itinerary."
8970,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Like most reviews on here, I am gonna go out on a limb and argue that this is probably the BEST Thai restaurant in the US."
8971,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,only bad side is the liquor isnt included in the buffet lol.
8972,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"These are all characteristics of one of the newest, trendiest, and best buffets on the Las Vegas Strip, the Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan."
8973,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The  Bellagio Buffet shows its age in the best of ways: upscale menu items usually reserved for 5-star restaurants.
8974,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I was in Las Vegas a few months ago, and the only thing that made my trip worthwhile was this restaurant."
8975,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"All in all I'm glad I went for the experience, but it is quite pricey."
8976,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"If you're a buffet person, you should definitely put this one on your list."
8977,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I've never been a fan of buffets, but the Bellagio's won me over when it first opened."
8978,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"All I have to say is ""Best Buffet EVER!!""."
8979,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,There are two reasons that I rank this as #2 is the value (not a very good value at all) and the side dishes were not up to a level of excellence that the other entrees were.
8980,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Enjoyed my sandwich a couple hours later, which also left my backpack smelling incredibly tasty."
8981,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I heard there are two locations on the strip, but I went to the Earl of Sandwich in Planet Hollywood-- and I think it's going to become a regular spot for future trips to Vegas."
8982,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Everything was just about perfect from the service to the food except for my hamburger.
8983,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,would totally recommend anybody to come and try these 2 dishes - but if you're coming alone - just get the chicken & waffles!!!!!
8984,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I recommend this place to anyone looking to eat a tasty burger.
8985,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Not at all, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal."
8986,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I thing i will try to come back for dinner soon!!
8987,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Do you get complimentary biscuits during dinner time like what the reviews say?
8988,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I'd want to go back to try different dishes.
8989,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Pros: 
- Almost everything was at least good, and a few items were downright great."
8990,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,He will sign up every year for as long as he can run & I will attend all events associated with the Rock N Roll Las Vegas for how ever long they will offer the VIP Spectator option.
8991,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"If you are near the Eiffel Tower, I would highly recommend this restaurant."
8992,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"its my favorite buffet, it has a restaurant quality for one reason: its the quality not quantity."
8993,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I first tried this place around 12:30am - 1am, so it's good if you have a late night craving."
8994,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"All in all a good experience but if you're looking for the best burger you've ever had, you probably won't find it here."
8995,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It will be the place I will compare ALL other Thai food to!
8996,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,One of the better buffets available to blob out at.
8997,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"This restaurant is by far superior to the other buffets at the hotels...and surprisingly, more reasonably priced!"
8998,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"If there is one buffet in Vegas that really kicks butt, it's the Rio World seafood buffet."
8999,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I don't often repeat my dining spots in Vegas, but I'll probably walk in and roll myself out again next time I'm there."
9000,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"All in all, I wouldn't pay $75 for that experience again."
9001,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It stands up to Gordon Ramsey's standard.
9002,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I think I died and was sent to heaven after eating at this place.
9003,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Definitely a great experience.
9004,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Every time we are in Vegas we have to come here for dinner.
9005,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,classy buffet.
9006,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The next time we're back in Vegas we're going here for burgers!!
9007,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"this place is so good, that our group had it at least every day while we were in vegas."
9008,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I will definitely go back again when I visit Vegas.
9009,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I came to Vegas to try all of the ramsey restaurant's, and honesty it was worth the trip and the wait...the line was long!"
9010,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I would have come back here a second time while we were in Vegas, but my significant other likes to vary his food choices."
9011,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"That being said, it is still serviceable French food and a worthy option if you are in a bind and looking for a nice restaurant at a fairly reasonable price (for Vegas)."
9012,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The buffet was not cheap but between the amazing food and my endless bloody mary's it was worth every penny.
9013,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Asian menu- 5\/5
Mexican street taco- 5\/5
Steamed crabs- 5\/5
Dessert- 5\/5

Italian, Meat Carving sections, and seafood are like 3\/5

but overall, so worth the 50$ 
My favorite buffet on the strip so far!"
9014,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This buffet was my absolute favorite for years.
9015,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Great little buffet.
9016,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I haven't been to the NYC location but I hope it's the same as the one in Vegas.
9017,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"It is the best buffet that I have ever had, however it is too pricey and the wait was long."
9018,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,One of the best brunches I had in Vegas.
9019,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,What a fun place to grab an awesome burger!
9020,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Summary:  the Wicked Spoon is, to date, the best buffet I've been to on the Las Vegas strip - including the village at Paris (by far)."
9021,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It's well worth the wait and it will cost a few bucks more than a traditional burger but go for the experience.
9022,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"The combination of great service, fun environment, and great food that is unique leads me to say that's BurGR deserves 5 STARS!!!!"
9023,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Funny story: the staff wear Gordon Ramsay bedazzled bluejeans... Ha!
9024,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Hi all, the whole experience was fantastic!"
9025,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,We were only in Vegas for the evening visiting a friend and we definitely made the right choice in eating here!
9026,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,One of the best las vegas buffet as far as I remember.
9027,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"The days of going to your Circus Circus, or Stardust buffet, are over."
9028,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Awesome place, portions were huge (which is their selling point) and awesome service."
9029,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,We went when our friend who works for Harris Corp. got family comps and decided to take my wife and I.  I have to say compared to the others in town it's pretty good.
9030,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"It will be I my ""must@ list every time I come to Vegas from now on."
9031,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"It's open 24 hours a day, so if you have those late night cravings, then this place has the sandwiches right there."
9032,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"My boyfriend thought the Bellagio Buffet was alright, then I took him here and he was mind-blown."
9033,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"There are so many good things to eat that it would take forever to list them, so I'll list the reasons they didn't get a fifth star."
9034,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Overall great experience and would recommend checking it out!
9035,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"And, I can assure you if you order right the meal is very economical."
9036,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,My favorite buffet!
9037,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place has it all and to everyone's liking.
9038,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Best buffet ever... That is saying a lot too because not a real big fan of buffets to begin with.
9039,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"This place has a pretty high price tag, (98 for 2) but I think it is definitely worth it."
9040,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is place should be on your bucket list for Vegas.
9041,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"A close second to Wynn Buffet IMO, but for the price, I might come here more often."
9042,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,My husband and I loved this place!
9043,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"While I have had many previous favorite go-to buffets in the past, nothing comes close to Bacchanal!"
9044,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Think I might of found another favorite restaurant.
9045,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"i live in San Francisco where there are thai restaurants on every block, but this is fan-eff'n-tastic."
9046,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Awesome buffet, one of the best I've been to in Vegas."
9047,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It is definitely  going to be a place we both recommend and revisit on future trips.
9048,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I can see why people call this place the best Thai restaurant in America.
9049,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,If your in Vegas and you like burgers go here even if you don't like burgers go =)
9050,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,My wife and I are not big buffet fan but The Buffet at Wynn is really good!
9051,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Although it was exactly the price I had thought it would be, the experience was great!"
9052,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is probably my favorite buffet in Vegas!
9053,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Other Thai restaurants could learn from Lotus of Siam!
9054,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"If you are a buffet person, then this place will be your cup of tea."
9055,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"So, in short, I definitely recommend this place as long as you don't mind the wait or price."
9056,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"All in all, Hash House was good but a bit over-hyped, over-priced, and probably not worth the wait next time we visit."
9057,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I don't know WHAT could top this buffet.
9058,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Not as good as a regular restaurant but it is the best buffett.
9059,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Always a good joint to go to.
9060,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Seriously, had better; but if you are a fan of waiting, and a huge slab of meat with little or no sides....enjoy!"
9061,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Price aside this buffet was colossal in size.
9062,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Gordon Ramsay knows how a restaurant should be run and this place is a prime example!
9063,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Will definitely recommend and will be back for this great dining experience!
9064,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Kept telling my friends they should come out and try this place.
9065,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Side note: A lot of people recommended sitting outside (to see the fountains) but honestly we realized while it would have been great for bellagio fountain and people watching it is much more of a dining experience inside.
9066,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Even with the plethora of options for a quality burger in Vegas, Gordon Ramsey BurGR proves itself as a top choice for me."
9067,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place is worth the price I paid.
9068,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Bacchanal Buffet might be pricey but it is definitely worth every penny and it doesn't feel like a buffet but a real trendy restaurant vibe.
9069,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Not to mention, the only buffet that gave us REAL linen napkins!"
9070,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Top ten restaurants I've ever eaten at.
9071,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Nothing spectacular , little better than Vegas regular buffet what you can eat for $15-20 off strip."
9072,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It's a must visit when in Vegas!
9073,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Everything is portioned- there are no large ass spoons that everyone and their sticky handed kid touches!
9074,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"You should try their burger, the best in Vegas, they got more and more types of burgers  , and the service was really good especially the manager Zac."
9075,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"There is some pretty stiff competition when it comes to buffet dinning in Vegas, but this place hands down takes the cake!"
9076,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"We wanted to stay at the buffet for at least two hours to get our moneys worth, and that we did."
9077,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Arguably one of the best buffets in Vegas!
9078,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I highly recommend Hash House A Go Go to anyone within a 100 mile radius of one of their fabulous restaurants.
9079,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is officially my favorite buffet in Vegas.
9080,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place makes Old Country Buffet seem like a desolate fast-food joint.
9081,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I will go back to this buffet.
9082,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,literally changed my view of sandwiches and made me think wow how did i not try this place sooner.
9083,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I normally dislike buffets but this one was probably the best one I've tried.
9084,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Still, I would go here again over trying another buffet."
9085,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It was a good place to try but I think I'd go to Wynn for the buffet.
9086,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Coming here is always a treat and at least once per trip...!
9087,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Other than that we always look forward coming to Bacchanal when we can.
9088,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"After seeing all of the great reviews, we knew we couldn't miss trying this place out."
9089,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,My all time favorite place to take any and all guests when they visit Vegas.
9090,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Such a quality buffet, I wanted to try everything!"
9091,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Definitely the best buffet I've ever been to.
9092,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Everything from your craving to what goes on in the actual restaurant is probably a good time.
9093,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,What's the point of going to any other buffet?
9094,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Best Breakfast buffet in Vegas hands down!
9095,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"even if you hate buffets (i'm not usually a fan), this one is worth a try!"
9096,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Everyone was happy with their meal (a rare feat).
9097,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Oh how I wanted to give this place a GREAT review with 5 stars.
9098,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I've seen a few refer to this as a tourist trap, but I didn't get that vibe at all."
9099,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I'll give this place five stars if they match this great experience every time we visit.
9100,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Great place for brunch buffet!!
9101,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Hands down one of the BEST buffets in Vegas.
9102,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"That said, I think I know exactly where I'm headed next time I need a tasty, healthy, and relatively affordable breakfast on the Strip!"
9103,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Other than that, I think it's a pretty good buffet."
9104,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place is a must have!
9105,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I highly recommend Mon Ami Gabi for an enjoyable and memorable Las Vegas Dining experience!
9106,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This past weekend we dined here * THREE * nights in a row for dinner !!!!
9107,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Another nice thing is its open 24 hours a day so I would go for breakfast hours as I think at night this would be the perfect drunk food.
9108,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place freaking rocks.
9109,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,If you're in Las Vegas you should make this one of your stops.
9110,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I love the food in the buffet.
9111,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"The most straight forward, classic buffet in Vegas."
9112,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place is CUTE!
9113,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"You can tell how popular it is by the long, long lines that this place has."
9114,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Came here on Sunday October 26 around 12:30pm for brunch and as a Las Vegas local I was actually impressed!
9115,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Truly a buffet worthy of the Gods!
9116,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Twice for dinner and once for breakfast.
9117,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This restaurant is located in the Paris complex and I thought it was very good.
9118,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Even if you've never tried or don't care for Thai food, I still recommend trying this place."
9119,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Nice and friendly day after Christmas.
9120,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I couldn't decide between here or Wicked Spoon, after reading an article that compared the two buffets against every category (from meat to desserts), Bacchanal won me over."
9121,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I've been to all of them on the strip and this definitely beats the Wicked Spoon, Bellagio, Wynn and the rest."
9122,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The Buffet at the Wynn is an excellent value and offers insane selection of food.
9123,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Definitely a good place to eat and to have a nice interior dining view of their restaurants.
9124,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Though, I would venture away from the strip and support some local small businesses in Vegas."
9125,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"We definitely wanted to come back here, but with such a short visit it makes for a good first night dinner to set the tone for your trip."
9126,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Overall for the price point it was completely worth it - which is surprising for a sandwich shop in the middle of the Vegas Strip
9127,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Once you enter however, the place looks legit."
9128,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I don't think the quality of the buffet justifies the $50 price point, but it is worth a try if you're in Vegas, plus it's the new ""must go-to"" buffet."
9129,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I can't say enough about this place.
9130,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"This place is pretty good, not somewhere I'd come often, but worth a trip when guests are in town or if you're a tourist."
9131,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,My first time here and everything was amazing.
9132,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Everything was good, came here twice."
9133,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,What a buffet!
9134,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,We actually went again on our trip just so I could try it again and it was just as good the second time.
9135,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"This was my first buffet in Vegas, and I must say, it was the best one I have been to yet."
9136,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Wicked Spoon Buffet in the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas is hands down THEEEE buffet of buffets.
9137,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Quite honestly, I do believe that the Wynn\/Encore buffet is the BEST Las Vegas has to offer."
9138,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Presentation wise...it was awesome.
9139,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Definitely a place to take Thai food lovers.
9140,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The Buffet at Bellagio is like one long foodgasm.
9141,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"If you like Thai food, do not go to Vegas without visiting."
9142,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"If you like them even in the slightest, I urge you to give these a shot."
9143,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place is pretty good.
9144,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I love this place.
9145,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I definitely recommend this restaurant if you are into Asian food.
9146,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Take a walk on the wild side of Vegas, and head over to Lotus of Siam ASAP!"
9147,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Definitely a nice buffet to try a variety of items and get some nice presentation and eye candy from it that you miss out on when you go to a buffet as to a fine dining restaurant in Vegas.
9148,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I definitely enjoyed it, it filled me up and definitely made up for the shity meal\/service I previously had at  (Hash House A Go Go) I wish I remembered the waiters name to give him some good feedback but I dont remember it."
9149,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The best buffet in Vegas!
9150,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Some of the best thai food I have had in the US.
9151,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"It's gourmet in a buffet form, and neatly portion-controlled with these nice presentations."
9152,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"This is by far, my FAVORITE SANDWICH place in the whole country (I think)."
9153,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,especially to experience a place where Hell's Kitchen was filmed!
9154,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"No Vegas trip is complete without a stop here anyways - at whatever time of the day, thanks to it being open 24\/7!"
9155,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It's more expensive than other buffets but it's so worth it.
9156,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Very good buffet.
9157,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Many a drunken sandwich has been consumed here at Earl of Sandwich, but plenty of sober ones have passed my lips as well."
9158,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Definitely a place to try at least once in Vegas if you're looking for a buffet.
9159,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I will be back here every single time I come to Las Vegas, I am planning on it!!"
9160,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,There isn't as much variety as the Wynn Buffet and the desserts weren't as good but overall I enjoyed my experience and will return.
9161,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"And when you're in need of something to munch on at 4am, Earl's got your back."
9162,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"they open pretty late on weekends, so it's a great place to grab a quick 4th meal."
9163,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I give this a marvelous 5 stars rating from my personal experience.
9164,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I'd bet this is a good place to visit after a few beers and the hamburgers can help soak up some of that alcohol!
9165,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Anyways, unless you are one of those people who are extremely picky about food presentation and texture\/taste\/etc, you're gonna be amazed by the selection here."
9166,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,We went here twice during our weekend trip.
9167,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I wanted to do a review on Earl of sandwiches because it is the BoMB...yes I use outdated phrases to express emotion but still....
9168,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,:) I plan on eating at the Downtown Disney location when I go in January.
9169,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I'd recommend to try this place at least once.
9170,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I've only tried probably 2 or 3 of their sandwiches and all were amazing, if you're looking to avoid the glutton fest at the AYCE's, stop by here at the Miracle Mile Shops."
9171,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Actually they were.better than my favorite Thai resthrant in LA area.
9172,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,There is free wifi which is good to checkup on things while relaxing and eating your sandwich.
9173,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Ambience not so great but definitely a 4am place to get some belly filling food.
9174,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It's a must if you are into buffets and eating way too much food in one sitting.
9175,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I wanted to take my parents somewhere nice while we were on vacation and Mon Ami Gabi did not disappoint!
9176,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,We have found our favorite buffet place in Vegas.
9177,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,We did the buffet of buffet (you can go to 6 different buffet as many times as you want within 24 hours).
9178,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Every Vegas trip, I literally find excuses to walk by Planet Hollywood so that I can grab a sandwich really quick and eat while I walk."
9179,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I mean, sure, I can say it's the best buffet I've ever eaten at, but still, I guess because everyone I know kept going ""OH MY GOSH THE BELLAGIO BUFFET IS LIKE THE BEST IN THE WORLD LIKE OH MY GOSH!"
9180,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"(4 stars) 

Hell's Kitchen Burger (Lunch $13) 
... is one of the popular burger choices with Asadero Cheese, Roasted Jalapeno Peppers, Avocado, and Roasted Tomatoes."
9181,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Roast sirloin, Bahn mi (pork sandwich), Korean squid salad, bacon mashed potatoes, and green beans were our favorites."
9182,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"It was a spectacular meal and lives up to the ""best Thai in the country"" reputation."
9183,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"For our meals, my wife ordered their Salmon, served with Lentils du puy, bacon, and beurre rouge and she fell in love with it."
9184,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place was pretty much the highlight of my Vegas trip after staying in a dirty room at Harrah's for three days.
9185,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Overall, the Bacchanal Buffet is not worth going to for dinner."
9186,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It's steep for $62.72 on a Sunday night but they don't kick you out and we stayed definitely more than half an hour after closing.
9187,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Overall, the buffet was delicious, we definitely ate too fast for our own good, but I think we were able to try almost everything."
9188,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Pricey, but you get what you paid for!"
9189,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I've eaten a lot of Thai foods in Asia and in the U.S, this is not the best but one of the better Thai places to eat... Tonight was my first time and I know I will be back again.... excellent food and excellent service."
9190,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Love this place.
9191,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"This place is the best buffet I have ever been to, and the next best place is not even close."
9192,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Hands down the best buffet I've been to in a very long time.
9193,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Overall, my family of five enjoyed our meal; however, after paying $270, we decided we would not visit this Resturaunt again because we were not able to eat enough food to balance the monetary compensation."
9194,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I would have to say this is the best Thai food I have EVER had!!!
9195,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"We had:

Sweet Potoatoe Fries
Frrrozen Hot chocolate
Shrimp Fettucini
Chicken Nachos

It was good, but I just dont think it was a $50 price tag good for 4 items in a place set up to look like an ice cream parlor"
9196,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I came up with the crazy idea to take my wife to one of her favorite restaurants for her birthday.
9197,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"With so much variety in Vegas, it's tempting to move on to another restaurant and another and another, but this one is definitely a keeper, will go again next time we're in town, regardless of the other temptations."
9198,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"After much research into finding a good buffet in Vegas, I found the Wicked Spoon."
9199,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Still craving it 2 days later.
9200,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The Wynn has some stiff competition now for buffet supremacy.
9201,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Food: I've had better French food in Seattle but I'm giving this place four stars for the experience.
9202,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I would definitely recommend this place and might be back in the future myself :)
9203,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I was craving their frites on the last day of our trip, so my friend and I came here around 6:30ish on a Sunday night."
9204,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"If you are around the area and want a quick, cheap bit, there's not many other better choices."
9205,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I usually love coming to this buffet, and it 'was' my one of my top 3 buffets in Las Vegas."
9206,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Most of the options were good.
9207,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Better meat selection, better sushi (although I see it sub par), best in dessert hands down, better service, and of course better pricing."
9208,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"But after seeing Kitchen Nightmares and hearing him preach about how to make a successful restaurant, trust me: DUDE KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT, and he absolutely practices what he preaches."
9209,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It doesn't get any better than this!
9210,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"This was my very first buffet after being married with my husband, and I have to say, that this is hands down the best buffet I have ever had."
9211,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place is a great place to eat in Vegas.
9212,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"My experience at Mon Ami Gabi was amazing, and I will definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas."
9213,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Best buffet ever!
9214,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,My mother is from France and she loved it as much as I did
9215,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Def check it out.
9216,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,caesar's palace went from being the worst buffet i've ever tried to being THE BEST!!!!!!!
9217,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Overall, its a great place to eat."
9218,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"BurGR is a top notch place, great service, nice friendly staff and excellent tasting food."
9219,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I know some may say this is a European tourist trap, try the food and service and you will love to go back again and again."
9220,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"If you can go to Hash House A Go Go and finish a plate by yourself, consider yourself a champion."
9221,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"While I would return, I would only do so if there was not a long wait and all items were ready as advertised."
9222,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is the ultimate place that people like just because it is trendy.
9223,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is a definite stop for me when I am in Vegas.
9224,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Definitely come with an empty stomach!
9225,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Such a pretty hotel to visit if you haven't been!
9226,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Its kinda funny how after eating here, the desire to go to Subway has ceases to exist."
9227,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Best buffet Vegas has to offer.
9228,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Love love love this place.
9229,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This buffet was pretty good!
9230,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is the best Thai restaurant.
9231,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,You can easily eat more than $50 worth of food at this place.
9232,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I rarely review restaurants but this one is something special.
9233,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I enjoyed the experience.
9234,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The experience and attention to detail in the restaurant was A+.
9235,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is the #1 buffet in Vegas.
9236,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"It took us about 2.5 hours to get into the buffet with 6 people, but it was worth the wait."
9237,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I compared to ones I've had in L.A. (L.A. is def better) but I mean c'mon what can you expect, it's good enough."
9238,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Recommendations on point, a must eat place."
9239,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This buffet is right up there with the Wynn buffet.
9240,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This buffet was great.
9241,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"They're also open late, so always good for a post-club run, or while you're shopping around in the day."
9242,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,At the end of our trip I polled everyone and the consensus best restaurant was Earl of Sandwich.
9243,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Its a must next time you're in Las Vegas!
9244,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,My favorite restaurant when I want to spend some money on good food.
9245,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I will definitely have to go back and try the other food items I missed the next time I'm back in Las Vegas.
9246,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Definitely worth it to eat here after a night out on the strip and your alcohol soaked liver is crying for help.
9247,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"This place is worth it, came twice in 4 days."
9248,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I'd definitely come back again for lunch or try the dinner.
9249,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"As a local, this is by far the best Thai food in Vegas."
9250,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This was a pretty good Buffet.
9251,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I'm so a fan of this place, I can't imagine a Vegas trip without going there."
9252,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Overall, don't only look to this place when it's late and you've been out all night."
9253,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"The rest of the buffet is good, but for this price range, I still prefer the buffet named after naughty cutlery."
9254,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Arguably the best buffet right now.
9255,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Very good experience!
9256,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place is truly amazing.
9257,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is the best buffet in Vegas (that I've tried).
9258,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,My favorite restaurant to bring my friends when visiting.
9259,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Earl of Sandwich has really good sandwiches at very affordable prices and IT'S OPEN 24 HOURS!!
9260,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Overall good!
9261,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Nothing ""food-coma"" induced but juuuuuuust right :)

Service was good, as usual :)
We always make a stop here whenever we are in LV, it's a must!"
9262,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,All in all it wasn't a bad experience--it just wasn't what we were expecting after eating in Ramsay's other restaurants.
9263,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I cannot say enough good things about this place!
9264,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is THE BEST buffet I have ever had!
9265,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,If it's supposed to be one of the best in Las Vegas but turns out to just be yet another great Thai restaurant?
9266,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I'd rather go to circus circus and spend 20$ on their comparable buffet and spend the remainder of my money on alcohol.
9267,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Best Vegas buffet by far.
9268,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The only thing I regret about my venture to the Lotus was that I was slightly inebriated before showing up.
9269,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"As a VIP at Caesars we get to skip the line, which is a HUGE plus because this place is busy."
9270,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"From beginning to end, it was an experience I'll never forget."
9271,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"All in all, a great experience, as usual."
9272,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"As Buffet's go this is the nicest, most elegant and the best quality food I have seen yet!"
9273,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Fortunately, this buffet upheld that end of the bargain."
9274,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,BurGR is unbelievable!
9275,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I agree, made the experience that much nicer."
9276,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"The servers were pretty attentive, which is great because this place was packed, and for good reason."
9277,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Compared to a buffet from home, it's really good!"
9278,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Pricey but definitely pay a visit if you get a chance
9279,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,You would never really know it was a buffet because the food isn't sitting in a chafer and the staff are always nearby tossing and preparing for your enjoyment.
9280,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This restaurant is located inside Paris Hotel and it was a great experience.
9281,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Grab some chips, ask the chef for some freshly grilled meat (carne asada was my choice) and drizzle on toppings galore at their amazing condiments bar."
9282,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I would defiantly come here again and try some other foods that I didn't get to try.
9283,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I don't appreciate paying full price for a buffet up front and then being forced to wait on purpose for our meal.
9284,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"If anything, I've been caught drooling at my desk, thinking about Lotus of Siam."
9285,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I LOVE the Bacchanal.
9286,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"On the expensive side for somebody who's used to $9.00 buffets, but well worth it."
9287,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"My friend alone, bought 4 different sandwiches for herself, so I didn't feel that bad for buying two."
9288,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I really recommend this place!
9289,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Real talk I LOOOOOVE me some Wicked Spoon!!

9291,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I was also very impressed by the buffet will definitely come back here.
9292,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,My overall experience here was great and I would definitely return to try some of their other items.
9293,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,We managed to finish everything and felt full.
9294,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Buffet is really not my thing but I have been to many of them and Bacchanal is definitely a quality buffet with a vast selection.
9295,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I like this hotel and the buffet is no exception.
9296,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Overall it was good but I can tell this is more of a Instagram moment place.
9297,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,worth every penny spent always recommending and i have eaten here plenty of times
9298,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Nice buffet.
9299,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Your wallet and taste buds will thank you.
9300,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I know I've been soo picky about my ratings lately but I can't give a perfect rating if there are some things that aren't up to par.
9301,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Grab a bite to eat here and then head down to the Fat Tuesday station and wash it all down with an alcoholic slush, doesn't get better than that right?"
9302,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This may quickly rise to my #2 restaurant on the strip (#1 is Joel Robuchon).
9303,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Excellent place!
9304,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Bacchanal Buffet is the ultimate buffet of all buffets.
9305,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Going back to Vegas in July and I definitely plan on coming back!!
9306,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,There were about 30 people already in line at that time which attests to the popularity of this restaurant.
9307,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"A Buffett wouldn't be a buffet without a desert station, and the Wicked spoon didn't disappoint here."
9308,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Wow, there are no words to desrcibe the monstrosity that is this buffet."
9309,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"After a good deal of research, we landed on Bacchanal, and it was pretty fabulous."
9310,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"The wait for this buffet can be up to an hour, but trust me it's actually worth it."
9311,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This restaurant is delicious!
9312,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,My overall review of this place is if you've never been you must go and try it for yourself especially if you like Buffet style this is a prestige buffet.
9313,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Everything was presented very well and expressed their passion for food and giving people the best dining experience.
9314,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,OVERALL: a fun place to try... once.
9315,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Had a lovely brunch here after a long night and it was delightful!
9316,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"So if you're on the strip, go down to Earl of Sandwich and order a sandwich."
9317,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Came to Vegas last Sunday and thought we would try the buffet at the bellagio, because of all the great reviews."
9318,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place is more than just a place to eat...sitting outside on the terrace is must!
9319,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"My favorite flavors were the Thai tea, passionfruit, mango, and blood orange (My memory is kind of hazy so some of those flavors might or might not have existed...) The only thing I know for sure is I loved the gelato station and it was my favorite part of this whole buffet!"
9320,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Traveled to this buffet on very high recommendation.
9321,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"however, being one of the top rated buffets in vegas, it wad due time to try."
9322,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is such a good choice for breakfast\/brunch in Vegas that isn't a buffet.
9323,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I could rant and rave about this buffet all day.
9324,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Guts and glory, well played Burgr."
9325,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The only thing I do not like is the name...this buffet deserves something so much more luxurious and original !
9326,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"But I've loved this place from DC to Vegas, and especially now that I have to be GF, I'm so glad Mon Ami Gabi is still an option on my list of restaurants, and I look forward to coming back soon!"
9327,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,i have came here for a sunday brunch with unlimited mimosas beforr and it was such a good experience  each time.
9328,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,But here at Mon Ami Gabi i have nothing bad to say!
9329,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,You are making a mistake if you come to Vegas and you do not eat here for brunch!
9330,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Full of locals, this is what I love about getting off the Strip in Vegas!"
9331,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"We called another Thai Restaurant on the same street, beautifully set it up for us for Saturday and they also have a pastries chef to do a beautiful cake for my wife and this venue is so clean and beautiful."
9332,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I need to go back and experience more of the food.
9333,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"All in all, it's a solid restaurant with good service and a nice alternative to just about everything else in Planet Hollywood."
9334,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Small complaints though for the best buffet I have ever been to, and the best (and most reasonably priced) meal we had in Vegas."
9335,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"If you in PH you gotta get it....it's something to try...I had it on my stay and thought it was pretty good, I think I'll make the stop next time I drop in."
9336,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I truly loved this joint in Planet Hollywood.
9337,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The most impressive was the seafood section.
9338,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,this is a place I always suggest when friends or family are visiting vegas :)
9339,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,definately the best buffet i've had in Las vegas.
9340,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I'd come back for a buffet.
9341,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Based on all the positive yelp reviews my family and I came here a few days ago, and I have to say, it was the best buffet I've ever been to, and, uh, I've been to a lot."
9342,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Soo good, and affordable.. Definitely my favorite restaurant in the city...I get shrimp cocktails and frites, and they each are very affordable for the portions you get."
9343,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"While they were pretty darn good the last time I was here, The Buffet now seems to be living off its reputation more than anything else."
9344,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The Buffet at Wynn is one of the better ones on the strip and worth the money.
9345,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Yeah, it's no wonder Bacchanal is rated the #1 buffet in Vegas!!"
9346,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It's located inside the Cosmopolitan hotel and everything in there is just extravagant and this buffet is no exception.
9347,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Mon Ami Gabi was able to bring sandwiches above and beyond the expectations I normally have.
9348,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,By far one of the best buffets on the Vegas Strip.
9349,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Okay food and lackluster service but glad that I  tried this place out.
9350,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Almost like eating at an authentic chinese restaurant.
9351,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,On the pricy side but worth going if your in Vegas.
9352,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,If you are going to Las Vegas in the near future you must go to this place and try the good out!
9353,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I would recommend stopping for a late nice meal,or a quick meal for the plane ride."
9354,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Definitely gonna get it again if I ever pass by Serendipity.
9355,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I found that to be a very unique quality at restaurants in Las Vegas especially buffets.
9356,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Restaurant was very quiet- it's a great place for a low-key evening.
9357,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,A perfect choice to enjoy delicious food with a great view.
9358,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Best buffet I been to.
9359,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I might return here, places to eat in Las Vegas are every where so one day ill return"
9360,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,My one complaint is what the hell if up with the outfits of the hostesses.
9361,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Overall though it was a great lunch experience.
9362,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is the reason we stayed at the buffet for four hours...
9363,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I don't know why, I feel here is better than bellagio, maybe I'm hungry today, lol."
9364,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I would definitely return to this buffet.
9365,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Overall, it was enjoyable."
9366,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,But one thing that sucked was that they didn't have a huge selection.
9367,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This buffet is pretty damn good.
9368,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The Best buffet in Las Vegas hands down.
9369,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I'm honestly not so crazy about buffets because the quality of food isn't usually the greatest, however at this buffer you get both good quality and quantity."
9370,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Definitely my favorite Thai Food in Las Vegas
9371,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I tried all of them and was quite satisfied with the quality.
9372,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,That's like the key to a good buffet.
9373,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Lovely outdoor dining area 
Basically I am in love with this place and can't wait to return on my next trip!"
9374,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,i'm a local and had never been so when out of town guests came to visit i figured i'd give it a shot - it was great all three times i was there (within a 2 week period) had lunch - croque monseiur (i'm sure i spelled it wrong) which is a french grilled ham and cheese - yummy!
9375,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Even though it has been about 3 weeks since I left Las Vegas, I still think about the buffet at the Bellagio and my mouth starts to water."
9376,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The food isn't cheap but the experience is worth the price.
9377,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Got extremely lucky that my group of friends and I were able to make it here within the last few minutes before the menu pricing changed over from lunch to dinner!
9378,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Get there early or make reservations to get a nice spot outside.
9379,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Pretty much everything you could realistically want form a solid breakfast\/brunch heavy place.
9380,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"glass bottles, cloth napkins, table presentation..very lovely place to eat."
9381,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I only have two regrets about my experience; only going there once on my 4 days in LV and not ordering the turkey and bacon, because I was trying to eat a little healthier."
9382,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"It was a good experience, and the food was good."
9383,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It's not something I would go back for or crave for but  is something light and close by that I can grab when at Planet Hollywood.
9384,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I thought this buffet was overall really good.
9385,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Wish we had gone here first so that we could have gone back before leaving LV.
9386,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The Wicked Spoon is by far my favorite hotel\/casino buffet.
9387,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,No room for desert.
9388,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,You are not going to find a better buffet in Vegas.
9389,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Came here a while back and it was pretty good, great ambiance and vibe."
9390,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I guess that's not a good thing for some people cause they're super pigs, but like I said I don't typical enjoy the idea of overly stuffing myself at a buffet, but this buffet was intimate enough that it wasn't overwhelming for me."
9391,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,More like you would find in a high end restaurant.
9392,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"In short...for details, read Jay F's review - otherwise, trust me when I say, GO TO LOTUS OF SIAM - you will thank me for it...at least until you're finding yourself craving it and being 1000 miles away...

Like Arnie Schwarzenegger once said....""I'll be back!"
9393,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Overall - I def recommend and will return.
9394,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,If your looking for a unique dining experience this is the place to go.
9395,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Bacchanal is basically the best buffet in Vegas right now.
9396,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"but, overall still gets my respect, i will be back, at the chef bar though."
9397,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,If you get a chance definitely stop at the Wicked Spoon to check out their wicked buffet :)
9398,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Good buffet though.
9399,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,There is nothing better than sitting outside with your girlfriends drinking champagne eating onion soup and watching the water show at the Bellagio as the afternoon goes by.
9400,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,A must-visit for every time I return to Vegas.
9401,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,We would definitely come back to this place again next time we're in town.
9402,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"If you're on the way to grab a Fat Tuesday and you want a snack to go with it, Earl's is perfect."
9403,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"They were continually replenishing the food items, so I was not worried about anything sitting out for too long."
9404,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,So far my favorite buffet in Vegas (haven't tried Caesears yet).
9405,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Cool and casual burger joint but at 5 star restaurant level.
9406,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Give this place a try and be sure to get in line early!
9407,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This sandwich shop is a blessing!
9408,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Mon Ami Gabi est excellent; bon emplacement et bonne nourriture... Coming to Vegas twice a year for tradeshows, one of my fave must-eat spots has become Mon Ami Gabi."
9409,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Overall, it's a great experience!"
9410,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Definitely a great experience if you love meat.
9411,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I'm happy tried it out, awesome dining experience!"
9412,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Not the basic kinds that you would find at the lower end buffets.. all the great stuff that is up to the caliber of CPK and other fine pizza establishments!
9413,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The best buffet I have ever been to in my life.
9414,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This has always been one of my favorite spots in Vegas to eat simply because it is consistently good and the service always spot on.
9415,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,""", however this burger place is a ""Hell Go!"""
9416,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Kind of pricey but good place to eat non the less.
9417,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I'm guessing there are a lot of great buffets in this town.
9418,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is the best buffet u can find in Vegas!
9419,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This restaurant was awesome it was totally worth the wait and the walking.
9420,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Best buffet I've ever been to!
9421,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,As far a quick bites and sandwich places this place is the bomb and I always come here a few times while staying in Vegas for a cheap bite to eat.
9422,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Too bad they don't have one of these restaurants in the Bay...
9423,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I have been coming to this restaurant for years now.
9424,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"gorilla that is Caesar's Bacchanal Buffet, but it does the buffet thing quite well and is certainly in the discussion as Las Vegas' second best buffet."
9425,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I'm not sure if buffets are really for me (especially not since I've been on weightwatchers), but as far as buffets go, this is one of the better ones."
9426,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I have brought in many sets of friends, recommended it to people on social services and all of them have had an excellent time."
9427,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"But I do want some roughage when I'm cannibalizing on a fresh, juicy piece of french duck in America's city of excess."
9428,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This has easily become my favorite buffet in Vegas now!
9429,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,You would never know that such a great restaurant was located inside an old plaza like this.
9430,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I'm not a buffet person, but this place was pretty good."
9431,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Every time I come to sin city, I make it a point to eat here."
9432,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Give this place a try.
9433,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I cannot express enough how awesome this buffet was.
9434,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The price tag may seem a little heavy but we planned our day around this meal and really felt we got our money's worth.
9435,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The food is very good and priced comparable to everywhere else in Vegas.
9436,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"For a nice dinner at nice restaurant your gonna spend about the same or more, but at least here you can keep getting more and more!"
9437,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The ONLY buffet I will go to.
9438,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"So if you want to try something new, try the Buffet at Bellagio and you will be pleasantly surprised because you never know what they'll be serving"
9439,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,definitely cheaper than the Wynn.
9440,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I love the fact that it's 24 hours in the city that never sleeps.
9441,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"We hit up this spot every time we go to Vegas 

Wait:  lines are super long esp on weekends but it's worth it."
9442,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"After eating here, we didn't even feel the need to eat at any other buffet."
9443,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I'm not sure why people keep telling me this place is the best.
9444,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Simply the bomb.
9445,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is officially my favorite Vegas buffet!
9446,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Prices extremely reasonable, especially considering this is a gourmet restaurant."
9447,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is probably the best buffet I've ever been to (both in and out of Vegas).
9448,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It was good but not as awesome as their chocolate waffle we had the day before.
9449,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is a better buffet the Bellagio in my opinion and equal to that of Aria.
9450,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Every time I go to vegas, I ALWAYS go to Bacchanal."
9451,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,so ... how can it be suddenly THE BEST BUFFET in Vegas?
9452,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Such an amazing buffet!!
9453,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Way better than the standard ones on the strip and well worth the extra few $$ it may cost you.
9454,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"When I read this had been voted as the best Thai restaurant in the country, this place deserved a visitation."
9455,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"i don't remember the last time i gave a 5 star review, but i also don't remember the last time i enjoyed a vegas buffet so much."
9456,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Skip the Bacchanal buffet and come here instead.
9457,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I would rate it 4.25 stars but since this is about as good as Vegas buffets - 5 stars.
9458,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Will do it again and again the next time I'm in Vegas!
9459,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Overall very nice job caesars!
9460,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Bellagio... keeping up their good name by keeping their buffet great.
9461,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Just for some background info, the buffet at the Wynn is by far my favorite one in Vegas, and I actually had not been impressed with any other one I had visited (yuck no Bellagio buffet for me)."
9462,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Where else can you get something like this for under $10 on the strip that's THIS good?
9463,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Great place for a nice, light lunch and you can probably order another sandwich to go for a little snack before hitting the club later that night."
9464,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Hands down the best restaurant in las vegas.
9465,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Super awesome dining out experience.
9466,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"EXCELLENT buffet :)

The only part of the buffet that I didn't quite enjoy was the Asian selection...but hey...the rest of it made up for it all the way!"
9467,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I went to 3 buffets last weeks (bellagio, wynn and wicked spoon) and this one is my absolute favorite."
9468,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Might be one of the best restaurants you can get on street level Las Vegas Blvd.
9469,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Must admit that Out of the plentiful times I've been in Vegas I always wanted to try this place.
9470,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"In absolute terms, this is a fairly good buffet."
9471,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"If you are on the strip, looking for a filling meal that won't cost all your gambling winnings, this is it!"
9472,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,When we  were about to leave we couldn't find our waiter half the time but overall it was still a cute experience.
9473,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Not cheap at all but compared to The Buffet we hit the night before, this was a much better experience, one that we were not disappointed in spending all that $ on."
9474,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Best buffet in vegas
9475,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,As far as buffets go - this is definitely the best one I've been to.
9476,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"They do have quite a small seating area and I'm usually not big on going down to the strip just to eat, but I wouldn't hesitate going back for more."
9477,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"We made a reservation on a Monday night about 2 hours before, and got a great table - half inside, half-outside with a great view of the Bellagio fountain."
9478,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Seriously such a great spot.
9479,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Decent four star restaurant located inside Eiffel.
9480,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,They have all Thai classics at a standard Thai restaurant price and trust me  you don't JUST come here for the pad Thai and Tom yum.
9481,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It was an overall good experience though.
9482,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"So here we go, the buffet at the Bellagio... the long awaited review for one of my favorite buffets of all time!"
9483,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,One of the best buffets of my life.
9484,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Hands down the BEST buffet ever!
9485,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I always passed by this place over the years and am glad I finally stopped in.
9486,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Thinking about it makes me want to drive up to Vegas right now just for the burgers.
9487,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The Buffet at Wynn is one of more decent buffets on the Vegas strip.
9488,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Will definitely return the next time we're in Las Vegas!
9489,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I hope there's an Earl around in San Diego because I'll def.
9490,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It's still my favorite buffet though.
9491,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Don't be turned off by the location-- Lotus of Siam is worth the hype.
9492,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I have become kind of a lazy yelper lately but really wanted to write about Burgr because I was really impressed.
9493,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,My only complaint was the lack of oysters on the half shell and seafood pizza.
9494,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,We waited much longer for food than other tables around us but it was worth the wait.
9495,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Very good choice for the $
9496,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"So Earl, if you are ever looking to expand, please look into Northern California (as I know there is one in Downtown Disney)."
9497,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Otherwise, we had a lovely experience at Burgr!"
9498,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I definitely loved the experience here.
9499,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Considering my last Vegas buffet was anything but satisfying at the Mandalay Bay, Bacchanal was very good, The only problem is they have so much to choose from, you can't possibly try it all."
9500,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"When you compare the quality & price of this to a chain, then yeah, this is cheap!"
9501,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,A genuine five star experience
9502,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"All in all, it was a worthy experience, but (especially as a local) I don't think all be back."
9503,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Dunno but when it came down to it,..it was the best meal in Vegas."
9504,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I enjoyed it, but needed to walk off all that food, which took a while."
9505,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I loved this place and expected nothing less as it is Gordon Ramsey's place.
9506,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This was my favorite meal on my vacation.
9507,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Overall this is a 2 thumbs up Buffet!
9508,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Overall experience was great...
9509,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It's a must do when in Vegas.
9510,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"We did however like bacchanal better, thought that the food was better, although there were certainly a few things that wicked spoon did better, so if you have time I would try both."
9511,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Wicked Spoon is my go to buffet when I go to Vegas and is probably one of my favorite buffets of all times.
9512,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The one and only weakness is its dessert selection.
9513,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Overall, this is a fantastic buffet."
9514,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Excellent service, reasonable Vegas prices for food that does not include french fries or gas bubbles and a great decor."
9515,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Ok, this really is as good as it gets when it comes to buffet."
9516,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,So amazing that I visited twice in during the same trip.
9517,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place is a must try if you're in Vegas.
9518,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Hands down the best meal I've had in Vegas in years!!!
9519,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is probably the best buffet i have ever been too!!!
9520,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I recommend this place to everyone!
9521,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Earl's is the only place we come for food."""
9522,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,If you're lucky you'll get one of their better items and really get double your money's worth.
9523,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,One of the best sandwich places I have ever been to.
9524,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,That was the most amazing buffet for brunch ever.
9525,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"They guy pretty much has chocolate in his blood, so this was definitely his jam."
9526,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Overall, my expectations were too high but this is still a good buffet... so many choices and so many things I didn't get to try."
9527,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Our entire experience was amazing.
9528,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place is a must go eat!
9529,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place as been thought out  and executed to perfection!!!
9530,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Im glad I ate here because of the experience and variety but not sure if I would go back.
9531,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Price: About $40\/person (cheaper if you're a rewards member)

Food: For a different and unique Vegas buffet, I'd highly recommend Wicked Spoon."
9532,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"4.5 stars

This is the best Thai food I've had in Las Vegas and some of the best I've had anywhere."
9533,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The Best Buffet ever!!
9534,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place was WAY better then most of food we had while in Vegas.
9535,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Other things ordered at my table were the sage chicken and waffle, the cornbread, a scramble, and a hash with sausage and asparagus... Everyone left happy :)"
9536,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I heard a lot of good reviews about this place and some of my friends kept on raving about it so we put it on a ""must-go"" list for me and my friends when we went last weekend."
9537,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,If you want to satiate your Vegas buffet experience then Bacchanal is the way to go.
9538,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place is a solid 5!
9539,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Would definitely recommend this buffet!
9540,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Despite that we would gladly go back to Mon Ami Gabi and I was happy to finally check this restaurant off my list.
9541,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"This place is very good,  If you love french food, your going to love this place."
9542,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,One of my all time favorite buffets.
9543,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Ok to be frank it was not as good the other place but it was still second best thai food that we have had.
9544,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,We will definitely be back again on future trips to Vegas!
9545,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I usually love buffets, but only if they have crab legs, which this buffet had lots of!"
9546,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I had expected to be wowed considering what I had heard about this particular buffet, but instead it was just ""good."""
9547,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It's ok. A lot more spacious than the one in NYC.
9548,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Everything from basic stuff to high end cuisine is presented on this wonderful buffet.
9549,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The buffet was good.
9550,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I recently made a solo trip to Las Vagas, and after taking advantage of the latest Stratophere thrill of jumping off of the top attached to a cable, I headed straight to Mon Am Gabi for a great dinner."
9551,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It IS one of the better buffets in Vegas (possibly the best!)
9552,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I had been looking to dine here for quite sometime and could not have chosen a better time to do so.
9553,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Another favorite buffet of mine in Vegas.
9554,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I came here hungry with a friend who said this place was great.
9555,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,One of the best thai restaurants in Vegas I've been here twice and both times I left very full and satisfied.
9556,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is my favorite place for a relaxed brunch (non-buffet) with a view.
9557,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Set the night to romance and hit this spot!
9558,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,One of my favorite buffets to hit up while out there in Vegas.
9559,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,One of my favorite places to eat in Vegas!
9560,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The sad conclusion I came to here is that open a Sandwich shop 24hrs a day in a location where drinking is one of the most popular activities and set your prices low you're guaranteed to get great reviews.
9561,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"After the meal, you definitely have to walk a couple miles to get rid of a piece of fried chicken."
9562,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Eat at the wynn buffet for actual good food worth the price.
9563,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Overall, this is probably one of the better Thai restaurants in Vegas (and most likely Nevada)."
9564,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,So of course I was happy with my experience at this one.
9565,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Best place I went to in Vegas.
9566,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Once you get passed the long line to the register I normally order 6 sandwiches because I go to Vegas twice a year and the line is long so I have to make it worth my while and share it with the family.
9567,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"It's a buffet, an upscale one with a vast selection of food."
9568,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,The best buffet in Vegas hands down!
9569,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"This is my favorite spot in the strip, too bad they keep messing up on food 3 several time in a row."
9570,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"When I think of a buffet I think of large pans filled withe piles of dried out meat or caserole-type entrees, Wicked Spoon has perfected the buffet experience by plating most entrees on their own individual dish or ramekin that you then place on your large dinner plate."
9571,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"(Little trick to cut down the wait time is to send one person to wait in line to buy the brunch ticket while another person waits in the line to get seated) 

I will come back next time I'm in Vegas!"
9572,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I read the reviews before which recommended this buffet for vegetarians.
9573,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Great Job wicked spoon!
9574,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Never had this money food and drinks at the same time.
9575,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I'm personally not a big fan of buffets and over indulging myself, but I will for this place."
9576,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I'm surprised there aren't more locations.
9577,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I love this restaurant!
9578,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"We tried Bellagio, Paris and Monte Carlo and agreed the Caesar Palace was best food we had during our entire week in LV."
9579,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"This place is definitely a spot where you get the 'bang for your buck'

Their Corned Beef Hash is good, their Chicken Hash is a bit on the dry side, French Toast is delish... so many selections... you'll definitely feed your craving here!"
9580,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is my new fave Vegas restaurant.
9581,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I would recommend this buffet, especially if you can make an earlier time so it will be the lowest cost."
9582,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I went for my bachelorette party a few years back and that was the first time I'd gone and so happy to have found this place:) Everything is good there, I can't even pick 1 dish..."
9583,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"If you want to experience what a high-end buffet is like, Wicked Spoon is your destination."
9584,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Most authentic, delicious Thai food in all of Las Vegas!"
9585,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Overall I had a good experience and would come back to try another burger and get those onion rings again.
9586,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,We have been to other famous buffets and this one is truly crafted and eclectic.
9587,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I'd go back in a second for any meal to try some of their other dishes.
9588,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I know one thing for sure - I will be back Buffet at Bellagio!
9589,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Cool for a buffet, but as a restaurant overall, eh, I'd mildly entertain the thought of returning."
9590,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Yes, I'm in love with this buffet."
9591,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Overall I'd definitely recommend having breakfast or brunch here at least once during your trip but maybe avoid weekends!
9592,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is a must stop for me whenever I am in Las Vegas.
9593,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Basically, if you are going to go to a buffet in Las Vegas, do it right, spend the extra couple of dollars and go to the Wynn."
9594,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I remember liking this restaurant the first time I went there years ago.
9595,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,So much better than Bellagio's buffet.
9596,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Or as close as I could get to heaven while being in Las Vegas!
9597,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Ok...the reason that I cannot give this buffet 5-stars is because, despite being quite possibly the best buffet in Vegas, I still feel the this buffet is too expensive."
9598,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I spent about an hour and a half there, slowly sipping my wine and reading my book while I ate, pausing every 20 minutes or so to watch the amazing fountains across the street (and the people watching isn't bad either :)."
9599,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"If you're okay with just smoked salmon, shrimp cocktail, mussels and one or two fish dishes, then you'll enjoy it."
9600,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"at the bar...

Just saying,still a fan though,so takecare now."
9601,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This buffet gets 3.5 stars from me.
9602,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,We made multiple stops here during our trip as there was plenty to try!
9603,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"With over 1500 reviews (mostly 5 star), this is no longer a secret."
9604,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Mon Ami Gabi...when you have such a beautiful name, there is little that can go wrong."
9605,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Be warned, though: This is a very popular place."
9606,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"At the end of the day this place delivers what i expect from a ~35 dollar buffet in Vegas

Some type of crab legs, a carving station with prime rib, a decent selection of fish\/seafood dishes, and sushi that doesn't suck too bad"
9607,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I've visited Earl of Sandwiches during every Vegas trip so far... won't break that streak!
9608,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I have gone for Dinner and Bruch and felt the brunch was more worth it than dinner just because it's a LOT of food.
9609,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"As I was trying to decide on salad selections, the server at the station praised the Thai salad, and declared it her favorite."
9610,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Anyway we will probably be back because it is pretty good for deserts and we've been other times and the service has been okay.
9611,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Price: you get what you pay for - order a few items, but bring a crowd, you'll need the back-up 
Atmosphere: whimsical and fun
Overall: Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll stop in the first night of the weekend, that way I'll have three days to finish the cake!"
9612,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"You can choose anything and it is fantastic,  When you go, try things off the Northern Menu for a unique and rare experience."
9613,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"When a place is so hyped up I'm usually faced with bitter disappointment but I'm happy to say that this time, with Earl's, I wasn't disappointed."
9614,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Just to make sure, we went again the next night because my wife had won a free dinner on the Identity Member wheel and we thought ""Well, lets use it because we dont want to lose it in 7 days"", plus, it was just that good the first time to go back the next night."
9615,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I would say don't miss it if you want a burger in vegas!
9616,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I highly highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who wants the best Thai food in the US.
9617,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I like this place very much, great customer service, great view, and amazing food."
9618,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Solid buffet - nothing special consider food.
9619,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Like this place needs another 5 star review.
9620,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,I liked it better when they changed the dishes at 3:30PM.
9621,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"It was amazing, one of the best dining experiences that I have had in years."
9622,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,You must go even if you're not a fan of Buffets.
9623,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It really is an experience that I think everyone should try at least once on their Vegas journeys.
9624,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,So far this buffet had set my standards for what a good buffet restaurant should be.
9625,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"I mean, it's difficult for any place to have thousands of review and stay in the 4\/5 star range right?"
9626,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,You will not regret it.
9627,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Some reviewers describe this place as the best Thai food in the US, it's hard to argue with them."
9628,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It's a COOL spot and it is FUN!
9629,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Overall, I think it's a great buffet, but some people may be disappointed simply because that tends to happen when other people rave about a place, particularly a buffet."
9630,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This place is always busy I recommend you make reservations.
9631,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Bacchanal is the best buffet in Vegas, neigh -the world."
9632,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Overall I liked the joint and would come back another time for lunch or dinner, but this time when I'm in perfect shape...."
9633,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Everyone seems happy, busy eating the food or in anticipation of it that it was truly just a great experience."
9634,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Overall, good presentations and I suppose worth a try just for the experience, but I don't think I would come back."
9635,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,SOOOOOOO GOOD.. if you are in Vegas you gotta try this place.
9636,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Looking forward to my next visit!
9637,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This was a perfect spot for dinner before a show on Saturday night.
9638,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Yes, it's more expensive than the other buffets, but if you don't do Las Vegas buffets very often, this is worth it!"
9639,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,We went in at 2:15pm when they still charge you their lunch price ($38\/person).
9640,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"The only bad thing I have to say about Wicked Spoon is that I did not take the time time to try it earlier - what was I thinking  - 
The food was was  excellent 
Service was amazing 
Never thought a buffet could match the service and food quality  of a upscale restaurant - Wicked Spoon has surpassed that expectation 
We will be back again and again"
9641,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,My one complaint with this place is that our waitress was the type of girl that didn't seem to like social interaction...
9642,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The nutella was not overpowering and it was such a subtly beautiful waffle I just dream about it.
9643,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"My Friend Gabi,

I love your cute Parisian interior, your dim lighting, your knowledgeable waiters and your delicious food."
9644,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The scrambled eggs were so tasty and delicious!
9645,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Food is fresh and hot even  on the buffet.
9646,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"If you want to feed a family of 4 with one plate of food, this is your place."
9647,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Everything we had was classic and delicious.
9648,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"They had a carving station for pork shoulder and prime rib, duck a l'orange, homemade Italian sausage, a fish cooking station, a tiny selection of sushi, a pasta station, some pizza, an impressive salad bar, an even more impressive dessert bar, et cetera."
9649,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Working in the food industry myself, that's something really worth noticing."
9650,QUALITY#POSITIVE,What I didn't know was that I was about to have one of the best meals of my life.
9651,QUALITY#POSITIVE,the best meal we had in vegas.
9652,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Service was snappy and the food very tasty.
9653,QUALITY#POSITIVE,When the sushi finally came up it was better than sushi I have eaten at other buffets..Hope that helps!
9654,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I came here, although it was a few years ago with a buddy of mine and the food was spectacular."
9655,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I think that this is the best burger joint in Las Vegas because of the environment and flavor\/taste\/presentation of the food.
9656,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I always wanted to taste one of his burgers and it tastes really good, not overly pricey for the location, quality and ambience."
9657,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Fresh seafood, sushi, pizza and lots of different dishes to chose from."
9658,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The prime rib was the consistency of butter, the best I have ever had."
9659,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Tried both and they both were very good.
9660,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"When it comes to hot food, my favorite was the little tiny cornbread with hot pulled bbq pork and cole slaw on top."
9661,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Huge selection with really tasty dishes.
9662,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Some of the items I've ordered in Mon Ami Gabi:

+Oysters  Du Jour - $15.95
+Wild Escargots De Bourgogne - $13.95
+Onion Soup Au Gratin - $9.95
+Caesar Salad - $11.95
+Filet Mignon - $35.95
+Au Poivre Burger - $13.95

Everything here was delicious and the service was 5 stars all the way."
9663,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I feel like that need to go back to some basics (flavors) of desserts before going for the decadent stuff.
9664,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"However, I can't speak for the Northern dishes because I've never been there, but everything I tried was heavenly."
9665,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The uber cheeseburger was very good, not sure I could taste all 4 cheeses but definitely the cheddar and goat cheese."
9666,QUALITY#POSITIVE,another great experience here... yummy bloody mary... good crusty bread and real butter...
9667,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The food is so fresh, and there are so many choices."
9668,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Mimosas were quality, though, I'll give them that - didn't taste like they skimped on either the champagne or the OJ."
9669,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The ambiance, the service, the accommodating attitude, the presentation, the quality of food , the taste-  all were as good as it gets!!"
9670,QUALITY#POSITIVE,This sandwich also paired very well with the creamy tomato soup.
9671,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Burger had good flavor, truffle fries were great."
9672,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"My favorite was the gelato station, where you can tell that it was good quality."
9673,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"It's in Paris Hotel and right across from the Bellagio so sitting outside, the view is great~ 

I was craving waffles and the chocolate hazelnut one here was SOGOOD."
9674,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Really good burgers and fries!
9675,QUALITY#POSITIVE,They had Bloody Mary and mimosa service while you waited for the table so I had two delicious bloody Mary's and highly recommend them!
9676,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Cuisines across the world, prepared gourmet in front of you, never left out stale."
9677,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Sandwiches taste good and made on spot.
9678,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The escargots are very good as was my crab sandwich (open faced w\/ a side of fresh potato chips).
9679,QUALITY#POSITIVE,This is one of those meals and experiences that I'm still thinking about because it was that good.
9680,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I tried the Gordon burger which has a pork patty, duck bacon, avocado, and other tasty things I can't remember."
9681,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Nothing was really notable except for these crazy cheese puffs (which I ate several bowls of the way one eats a bowl of cereal).
9682,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The lamb was really good but that was probably the only other type of food that stuck out out of everything that was offered.
9683,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food and service were both impeccable.
9684,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The steak was juicy and tender, and it had great flavoring."
9685,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The beef noodle soup was pretty good.
9686,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I'm not sure how they pack so much flavor in a burger, but I enjoyed it!"
9687,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Better selection and quality and a cleaner brighter atmosphere.
9688,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Their meat was cooked perfectly and so tasty!
9689,QUALITY#POSITIVE,There was also a sweet jalapeño aioli dipping sauce that these fries just had to keep making love to.
9690,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Good food, beautiful setting, great service."
9691,QUALITY#POSITIVE,It was so good that my two friends sitting on either side of me kept dipping their bread in my bowl!
9692,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The curry and coconut flavor paired perfectly with the egg noodles that came with it, and I am positive would taste amazing over some fried rice."
9693,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Even hubby, a burger lover, says that Slater's 50-50 burger in San Diego is miles ahead on flavor and quality."
9694,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The atmosphere alone is reason enough to come to this restaurant, but when you add on fantastic food, your have a sure bet (please don't mind the Vegas pun- LOL)."
9695,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food is very fresh and there's an awesome variety.
9696,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food was great and fresh!
9697,QUALITY#POSITIVE,nigiri and roll sushi were passable--excellent by buffet standards.
9698,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The French toast was also good--light and fluffy (with a good flavor).
9699,QUALITY#POSITIVE,There's a huge choice of hot and cold food and the desert is fantastic.
9700,QUALITY#POSITIVE,They also place of fancy bottom of (purified) tap water on your table.
9701,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I was so stuffed of good food.
9702,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The items also come really classy!
9703,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Great buffet with really rich foods (bone marrow) and hearty meat dishes.
9704,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Great quality of food that seems to consistently be fresh.
9705,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I definitely would recommend checking this place out, the burgers are delicious and the prices aren't outrageous :) however, the wait time during prime dinner hour is probably really long."
9706,QUALITY#POSITIVE,We had breakfast here the day of my brother's wedding and it was quite a treat.
9707,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"At first the prices look expensive, but when your food comes it is well worth the cost."
9708,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Price was right, service exceptional and the food tasted fantastic"
9709,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I started off with some gnocchi with a lamb ragu and olive oil poached fish, but as I walked further down, my eyes lit up at the sight of a stack of bones all exposing its delicious marrow for all to see and feast on."
9710,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Excellent quality and great tasting food.
9711,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food was fresh.
9712,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Seafood... ok.. took almost everything here because of it's cost and it's taste.. all seafood were great as there were many to choose from... but most memorable was the sea bass... SUPER BUTTERY like you are eating butter straight up!!
9713,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"However, if you want to sample a number of different items, want some quality with your quantitiy, want to stuff yourself on nothing but crab legs and shrimp, desire a fairly nice setting, don't mind the wait, and are stuck on the Strip, then the Wynn buffet is a serious consideration."
9714,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Paris, is superior food for about 30% less money."
9715,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I took a bite out of it and it really was good!
9716,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The food is very fresh and as a beer fan, I loved that one of the items on the menu was a cheap tall can in a brown paper bag."
9717,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"If you pick off the salmon off the nigiri, you can get some good sashimi bites, though."
9718,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I had the chicken burger and even that was really good.
9719,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Everything was very gourmet and the presentation was on point.
9720,QUALITY#POSITIVE,LOL Its fresh and the marinated meats are so tasty.
9721,QUALITY#POSITIVE,It definitely has a Parisian feel and the breakfast food is wonderful.
9722,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Sushi: not the best best best sashimi quality but it's a buffet and for a buffet, pretty good nigiri."
9723,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Everything tasted fresh.
9724,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Everything was cooked just right and, despite a full restaurant, delivered promptly."
9725,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Loved the quality of the food, service and ambiance."
9726,QUALITY#POSITIVE,and my mom had the special fish of the day: chilean seabass with a corn that is beyond the concept of corn (so good).
9727,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food is absolutely delicious and incredibly fresh and flavorful.
9728,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The sandwich fillings were not so robust.. more like they blended together so beautifully with the baked to order bread, the cheesy gooiness, and the fresh meats and  veggies."
9729,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I was full within 3 dishes but they offer a great selection of food with GOOD quality as well.
9730,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I enjoyed my dish, it was very flavorful, but honestly, it just tasted like a meat sauce from a pasta dish."
9731,QUALITY#POSITIVE,They have a great selection and nothing was spit out bad (like most vegas buffets) there was one section with mini cups of experimental fruits and spices; its a must try and was stand out from the whole buffet.
9732,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The burgers are the perfect size not too thick but not super thin, they also come on a unique bun that suites the burger well."
9733,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"There's a fantastic crepe station, and gelato also."
9734,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"When you go, be sure and stop by the seafood station and have the chef cook you a customized fish dish."
9735,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Overall I felt cheated out of bomb fried chicken lol so did the other people in our group.
9736,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"this was my second time eating here and it's still my favorite restaurant in Vegas.....I'm sure there are places with better food, or a better wine list, but i'm willing to bet they are buried deep inside a hotel or a casino and no matter how much you dress them up, and decorate the room, NONE can match the amazing ambiance of Mon Ami Gabi."
9737,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food was heavenly and I can see why it's the place to go.
9738,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The sauce is great over rice.
9739,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The bloody mary is a perfect combination of all ingredients-not to tomatoey, with just enough citrus and heat to give your taste buds a kick and vodka to get 'cha mind right for a long, fun day in Vegas, lol."
9740,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Fast, inexpensive and good taste, that's pretty rare for las vegas good."
9741,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Dessert section was delish!
9742,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"So, I have a pretty good idea of the consistency and quality of the breakfast buffet experience and let me tell you, it absolutely lived up to all expectations; it's my favorite breakfast buffet in all of Vegas."
9743,QUALITY#POSITIVE,They did have made to order korean pancakes which were rather flavorful and some interesting pizza choices which included bacon and manchego cheese.
9744,QUALITY#POSITIVE,A wide variety of quality food including deserts.
9745,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Most of the Asian dishes were very good, and the Macaroni and cheese was ridiculous!"
9746,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The salads were great but the fish preparations were simply ourstanding.
9747,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The food is great , large portions at reasonable prices."
9748,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"One of the best steak I had during my trip, and even the creme brulee was the right amount of softness."
9749,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"There are several ""must have"" dishes at Wicked Spoon:  the French Toast was almost as good as homemade French toast that is left to marinate to sogginess in egg; the Eggs Benedict were fantastic--as good as a la carte at any brunch place."
9750,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Great steak and fish dishes, a good variety of wines to choose from and wonderful desserts make this a place worth visiting twice!"
9751,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The temperature, texture, flavor, and overall quality of the food were just right and met my expectations."
9752,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Great meal, great food!"
9753,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"My boyfriend got the hog burger and he loved it, it's a pork burger and it was cooked very well and he liked it but he did say he preferred a regular burger over the pork burger."
9754,QUALITY#POSITIVE,It made for a very pleasing side to the steak.
9755,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The only sandwich I tried was their Tuna Melt but it here but it had to be the best Tuna Melt I've ever had...so good in fact, that I had to go back again for another one!"
9756,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"There was a great selection of food- seafood, Chinese, sushi, American, Italian, and a small salad bar."
9757,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Tastes great even when cold and it makes the best bedding for your tummy before your crazy adventure time.
9758,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"They were excellent, that steakhouse style crispy fall-off the-onion beer batter version - not those awful frozen breaded things you get in so many chain restaurants."
9759,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The broth was seasoned and demonstrated respect found in preparation at a Japanese ramen house.
9760,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I paid $30 for a burger and fries at this place... And was good...
9761,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The BBQ was solid.
9762,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The food is great for a buffet, we stuffed ourselves silly....two days in a row."
9763,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The macarons and mochi were pretty good (though you're only allowed to get 2 mochi at a time, due to demand)."
9764,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I like the fact that they only use one type of bread which is good so it doesn't leave you with thoughts of ""what bread should I get"" ""Will this bread be good""."
9765,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Finally, the food was an overwhelming array of good quality ingredients and preparations, featuring a variety of cuisine cultures, and a spectacular selection of desserts."
9766,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The view from the patio, great customer service and delicious French inspired food combine for an all around amazing experience!"
9767,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Just outstanding so much variety and great quality.
9768,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"That being said, they put a lot of work into their desserts and that very much matches the level I expected."
9769,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"It really is perfectly clarified too, as you could tell by the cup of butter that I had sitting with me during my meal that did not congeal one bit at room temperature."
9770,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Fresh, inventive, delicious comfort food and ginormous portions!"
9771,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Overall the service and food deserves 4 stars.
9772,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Just pay attention to the burger when it comes out, it's really neat!"
9773,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Have been going to this place for years, I'm sad that they have done away with the all you can eat lunch buffet because ordering off the menu can get a little pricey, but the food is always delicious!"
9774,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I am not much of a meat person so couldnt do much justice to them, but I did taste the shrimp, and chicken, and they were good!"
9775,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Hard to find anything more authentic than those.
9776,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Thats a fail...but for the price and quality of all the other wonderful dishes more than made up for it!
9777,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"One of my favorites and is was perfectly cooked medium rare, with just the right amount of sauce."
9778,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food was decent (better than average) but the price was absurd ($34) and the line was long.
9779,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I always get the filet mignon with steak frittes, which is easily the best choice on the menu."
9780,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food was all very fresh which is not often the case at buffets.
9781,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food deserves a 4 STARS.
9782,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Hands down best meal of the weekend!
9783,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Good quality food, beautiful restaurant with knowledgeable friendly staff!"
9784,QUALITY#POSITIVE,sooo wonderful and flavorful... no need to describe them anymore.. just go taste them for yourself!

9786,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The food was good, service was great!"
9787,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Although I practically inhaled both of my sandwiches (I was hungry), I washed them down with several refills of their very tasty Earl's Lemonade, which has earl grey tea in it--kinda like their version of the old Arnold Palmer."
9788,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The only things I found to be impressive were the service and the wine.
9789,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I had the crab spinach artichoke dip for an appetizzer ----which was so good i practically licked the bowl clean lol.
9790,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"the bread makes the sandwich as it is toasted and very good, almost like really good mexican torta bread."
9791,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"They fall off the bone, melt in your mouth, and are effortless to eat."
9792,QUALITY#POSITIVE,But the service was great and her scallops were perfect.
9793,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Mix everything together, with a touch of the sauce, and you've got yourself one of the most tasteful things ever."
9794,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"the regular food is good, but way too over priced."

9799,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"If you like seafood, you can't go wrong with this dish!!"
9800,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food was pretty freaking good even though I wasn't feel well I enjoyed most of my food.
9801,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I could not finish the salad because the portion was huge which is why I think the 17 dollar price tag was fair and the tuna was so good!
9802,QUALITY#POSITIVE,their seafood drunken noodle & pad thai was HELLA good and i just have no complaints....except for the ghetto plaza its located in.
9803,QUALITY#POSITIVE,They were cooked perfectly and the taste was fancy restaurant quality.
9804,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Best buffet on the strip hands down.. prime rib, crab legs, cornish game hen,and their small desserts are amazing."
9805,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I'm usually not a fan of ice cream, but Serendipity's sundaes got me hooked!"
9806,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The service is wonderful here, the food is delicious."
9807,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The burgers
The meat is definitely the star of the show, and Mon Ami does a good job constructing it that way."
9808,QUALITY#POSITIVE,We were there for almost 3 hours because we had to try all their foods!
9809,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"10 ounces of prime medium rare NY Strip beef on a toasted French roll around 18 inches long; slathered with garlic butter, covered with three over easy eggs and six crisscrossed thick cut smoky, sweet, salty, crispy bacon."
9810,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Each dish didn't look rushed or like it had sat out for a long period of time.
9811,QUALITY#POSITIVE,A little too many blueberries for me but it was super yummy .
9812,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The shrimp is very fresh and the simplicity of the dish speaks for itself.
9813,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"My favorites were the corn, wagyu sliders, fried chicken, potatoes au gratin, tater tots, meatballs, flan and gelato."
9814,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"It's like an endless, flaky bowl of chicken and vegetables."
9815,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Just a tasty sandwich on delicious bread for a great price, especially as we were on the strip."
9816,QUALITY#POSITIVE,By the way The burger taste was great and amazing the plating.
9817,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The food in the service were exceptional, without a doubt the best Thai food I've ever eaten in my life."
9818,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Haha my favorite was the chicken sausage\/mashed potatoes from the American section and the freshly made pulled turkey street tacos were to die for  super delish!
9819,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"love the patio seating, great seats for people watching especially in the blazing heat.... but hey get some mimosas to cool you down.... they had a bloody mary bar which i thought was really amazing...they give u a plain bloody mary and you can add all your garnishes with a variety of olives, celery, all kinds of hot sauce!"
9820,QUALITY#POSITIVE,But with the excellent service and food the second time I decided 3 stars would be fair.
9821,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Unlike the breakfast buffet at Planet Hollywood, everything my husband and I tried here was delicious."
9822,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I got the corned beef hash which was good, and my fiancé had the biscuits and gravy & really liked it."
9823,QUALITY#POSITIVE,My god those combinations of flavors goes well.
9824,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"They have some pretty solid dishes, price wasn't too bad $40 but let me say one thing KOBE BEEF \/ Crab legs were amazing, sushi selection kind of sucked, and the desert\/fruits were nice and fresh, with that being said well worth the 40 dollars spent."
9825,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Since it was Chinese New Year's, the Asian offerings were tremendous."
9826,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The mini donuts were a palatable treat.
9827,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Great sauces in all their dishes.
9828,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Both brunch and dinner are delicious.
9829,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Sure there are no exotic dishes like flamingos that were served during Ancient Rome in this buffet, but the variety and quality of food remains the same."
9830,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"There was a great variety of food, all looking very fresh and tasty."
9831,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"From the super-staff to the seductive salads, from the perfectly-cooked crab legs, wild boar sliders, duck ravioli and custom risotto bar to the moist-beyond-belief cake balls, macarons and homemade marshmallows... whatever you're doing, please keep doing it!"
9832,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"We ALL were in awe of the selection, quality and quantity."

9835,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I was personally a huge fan of the fruits section during this brunch.
9836,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The scallops were seared perfectly, the shrimp was perfect, the peas were a perfect addition to the plate -- the dish was perfectly perfect."
9837,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Whether its Friday night at 4am after the club, or 12pm Saturday afternoon after a long night, Earl's tastes good at any hour of the day."
9838,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The portion was small but the crispy rice on the bottom was enough to send us off the edge -- it was THAT good

Nuer Nam Tok -- a version of grilled beef but with toasted rice sprinkled all over giving the sauce a thick consistency which clung to the meat."
9839,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Burgers were excellent and should be since it's their namesake ;-)

It's the kind of place I'm really glad we tried but I don't know that I'd come to again because there are so many great places to try when in Vegas!"
9840,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Be patient, it is always crowded and service is not that good (the food is, though)."
9841,QUALITY#POSITIVE,My friend ordered breakfast and when her pancake came out her mouth hit the floor!
9842,QUALITY#POSITIVE,My favorite was the kao soi but the other dishes were good.
9843,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I didn't like the decoration but the food was super tasty.
9844,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I usually went with a house salad for $1.79, despite how tempting all the little treats around were, like the triple chocolate brownies or the chocolate banana muffins."
9845,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The sandwiches were typical, but the soup and salad exceeded my expectations and I would  definitely order them again next time."
9846,QUALITY#POSITIVE,There were many selections that I loved and basically this was my meal.
9847,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Who knew the French could make great burgers?

9850,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I am not normally a huge dessert person but omg, did i die."
9851,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The Duck a L'orange, filet merlot, short ribs, bone-in ribeye and seafood platter have all been high hitters."
9852,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"For example, for lunch I tried some of the best mashed potatoes I have ever had at a buffet and at most restaurants, and I normally do not go near carbs when I'm at buffets."
9853,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Prices are good, line isnt really that bad and its a good sandwich!"
9854,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Admittedly the sandwiches themselves were nothing spectacular on the palate, but Earl of Sandwich wins four out of five purely on the value that you are getting from the quality of these six dollar sandwiches worthy of Vegas's demanding taste buds."
9855,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Burgers and sage fried chicken definitely a must.
9856,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"This place is the typical large selection of foods, but it comes with great quality."
9857,QUALITY#POSITIVE,They have a nice selection of food This place uses real good quality meat.
9858,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"As soon as I grabbed the warm bag in my hand, I knew I was in for a toasty treat!"
9859,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"My bf usually aims for eating only the prime rib and king crab legs, but the buffet was so good that he was willing to add other items (such as filler uppers like pastas and veggies)."
9860,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"In addition, the dish came with a side of beautifully roasted cherry tomatoes that added an extra kick of flavor."
9861,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Everything was fresh, excellent quality and ALL fully digestible :P

I highly recommend this buffet."

9864,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The Chef won James Beard awards and Wine Spectator Awards years in a row for good reason.
9865,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The lamb chops and the sliders were really good, but I fail to see why this place carries so much hype with a high price tag."
9866,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Flavorful, quality, and a great variety of choices for every palate and or dietary restriction."
9867,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"There weren't a lot of things that stood out, but the quality of everything was above par."

9870,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"As others have mentioned, almost all  the dishes could work as a terrific entree."
9871,QUALITY#POSITIVE,This is currently our favorite Vegas buffet - it is pricy but you will get high-quality food and massive variety.
9872,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food is very tasty and you can't beat the view.
9873,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The coffee was really good and the prices did not reflect the large portions.
9874,QUALITY#POSITIVE,While the food was really good I should explain the situation that causes me to rate them so low.
9875,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Both were delicious, perfectly seasoned options."
9876,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The buffet is little smaller selection wise than other buffet on the strip, but it was quality food."
9877,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"A tad overwhelmed by the ridiculous portion, but every bite and every urge wanting to pass out was soooo worth it."
9878,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Food- between my husband and I, we ordered five dishes and we cleaned the plates because it was so delicious."
9879,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Very high quality food.
9880,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Gordon Ramsay's burger patty carries on its shoulders the strength and daring of a perfectly-seasoned steak the way Santa Claus carries a bag of toys, and drops them on your taste buds like it's some kind of flavor Christmas for your tongue."
9881,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I also nabbed a few bites of hubs' quiche lorraine - also a delightful, rich and tasty choice."
9882,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Chipotle Chicken Avocado Sandwich - $6.99- Chicken is seasoned nice and you get small hint of the chipotle.
9883,QUALITY#POSITIVE,It all tastes as good as if you would have ordered each item on its own at a 5-star restaurant.
9884,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Italian food station: excellent Lamb chops (was cooked medium but was still soft and tender).
9885,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Dessert has really improved a lot over the years.
9886,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Some of the most delicious food here in Las Vegas!!!
9887,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Spaghetti and Veal Meatball (I'm a meatball fanatic, I loved this dish, perfectly personalized portion so you don't get full)

Green Curry Noodles (served in a little Chinese to go box)

Cowboy bacon (never have had this dish before in my life, served with a potato underneath - phenomenal!)"
9888,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"And if you still have room for dessert, definitely try the strawberry shake with coconut pudding."
9889,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Desserts were excellent ... Food was super good... Of course wait time was a bit long but it's worth it !!

9893,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Fried chicken benedict: To my surprise, I liked this dish a bit more than the chicken and waffles."
9894,QUALITY#POSITIVE,But what I had was damn good!
9895,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I've never been to a buffet that was able to do Chinese dim sum dishes properly, but the Bacchanal pulls it off."
9896,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I would probably pay the $22 just for the cheesecake, it was that good."
9897,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The truffle aioli sauce had the tart\/sour taste that complimented the salty fries.
9898,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The plating was over-the-top, with some unneeded elements, but the flavor was definitely there."
9899,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Each looked delicious and not like normal buffet food.
9900,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Salad bar was very good too, but I only looked."
9901,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Chicken larb - ground chicken dish
Pad Kee Mao - stir fried ""drunken"" noodles
Chili fried rice
Garlic prawn - shell-on deep fried shrimp
Crispy duck with Penang curry
Beef with string beans - can't remember the exact name of the dish
I liked every single item we ordered and will definitely try to make a trip there again when I go to Vegas."
9902,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The selection is almost your typical vegas international faire but to a higher level.
9903,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Definitely recommend you to get this one if you don't want something too heavy or filling.
9904,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The food beyond makes up for the area, though."
9905,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Some of the best food I've had anywhere, all ready instantly, all prepared in a visually pleasing way."

9909,QUALITY#POSITIVE,You will definitely eat until you can't possibly eat anymore at this buffet!
9910,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The lamb chops were terrific and a change from standard buffet food.
9911,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I unfortunately only went during their brunch hour, but already the flavors were great."
9912,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I really liked the dessert table, gelato bar, chocolate dipped strawberries with either oreo cookie crust or crushed heath bar, just wish i had saved room for more dessert there was a bunch of other desserts i wanted to try but just didnt have room."
9913,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The desserts, by the way, were incredible, so leave some room!"
9914,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"but they also have dishes that are a nice twist and a treat considering i don't get to eat that way often like the goat cheese mac & cheese, oysters, crab cakes, and bone marrow."
9915,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"If you don't order the crispy rice salad, then don't bother eating here."
9916,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I tried three different flavors and they all were amazingly delicious!
9917,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Everything we had was good!
9918,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"If you've ever had really good shrimp and grits (such as those from Charleston) these might fall a little short of your expectations, but they were my no means bad."
9919,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I have been to SEVERAL thai restaraunts since moving from Las Vegas and have yet to find one where the food and service can match up.
9920,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"It didn't necessarily disappoint either, as the food was all really good."
9921,QUALITY#POSITIVE,This is kind of weird too but I just loved the water they served.
9922,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I would have given the place 5 stars as the food was phenomenal and the service was on point however I am taking one star off because of the wait in line.
9923,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I always find restaurants mess up steaks a lot but not Mon Ami Gabi.
9924,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The corn beef hash was really good and paired so well with the runny egg yolk!
9925,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Best thing I ate was the roasted chicken carbonara.
9926,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Monstrous proportions, excellent tasting food, and cheaper than most places in Vegas."
9927,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I don't mind to pay for a good quality food, and Bellagio has all this ."
9928,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I've tried two different ones: The original and the double chocolate and they we're both super good, especially on a hot day!"
9929,QUALITY#POSITIVE,This allowed for the food to be freshly prepared and certain food items did not sit there and dry out.
9930,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The sauce isn't what I would think of as a Caribbean Jerk sauce, but I didn't care because it was soo good."
9931,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I will definitely be back, even just for the garlic prawns, and plan to try some new dishes!"
9932,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The spaghetti with meatballs was great.

9935,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food is always fresh and interesting.

9937,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Some items were cheap throwaways for people to fill up on, just like all buffets, but the big ticket items were ON POINT!"
9938,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I had the ham and cheese crepe and it was sooo good.
9939,QUALITY#POSITIVE,i have came here for a sunday brunch with unlimited mimosas beforr and it was such a good experience  each time.
9940,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The burger creations were as eclectic as the place itself; the Farm burger being my favorite.
9941,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"and ever since then, I have been ordering crab fried rice in every Thai restaurant that has the dish on their menu."
9942,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The food was delicious, service is excellent, and the views are nice."
9943,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Since items change regularly and I'm sure the quality varies during different times throughout the day but when we went on a Saturday night around 7pm, everything was the highest quality."
9944,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Ok on to the food.
9945,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I am from NJ and am used to diner food (large portions of home cooked comfort foods), but this was diner portions of creatively delicious comfort food."
9946,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"For my second plate, I decided that since the Asian noodles were so absurdly good that I would load up on that, some more pizza slices, rice, and some Korean beef."
9947,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"- they serve great cold crab legs during dinner

- omelet bar

- plenty of meats like cured ham, roast beef, and fried chicken!"
9948,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"A little pricy at 50.00 a head,  but fresh with great selection."
9949,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"My fav all time brunch plate...yes the lines long and it takes 4ever to get a table at times, but its food is amazing...the fried eggs benedict is the most amazing breakfast item I've ever had (I've had it several times and its always been relish... the juevos ranchers believe it or not r the only juevos rancheros I'll ever eat..and lastly the original frooozen hot chocolate is a sinful treat very chocolatey"
9950,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Food tasted fresh and their breakfast selection was decent- they even had red velvet pancakes!
9951,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The pancake\/crepe is prepared very well with the center being moist with the lemon filling and the edges being crunchy.
9952,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I thought that their food was very unique and it was all good quality.
9953,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Seafood Station #1: Where all your money is going toward!
9954,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"It's worth the money, everything here is delicious and the decor is amazing."
9955,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The juices are fresher the desserts are better, the menu is more unique and even the presentation is just better."
9956,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"So many to choose from, all so yummy AND they had a gelato bar."
9957,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The nachos, sweet potato tots, gourmet meat\/cheese selection, and the TRUFFLE SOUP were amazing and worthy enough for seconds."
9958,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"None of the food I tried tasted ""fresh"" and ""just out of the oven."""
9959,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The food was what I expected, just amazing!"
9960,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The dessert selection and quality is very good and we enjoyed that part of the meal.
9961,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The Earl Club:
 - a basic yet filling turkey bacon sub
 - nothing out of the ordinary 
The Full Montagu: ***personal fav***
 - roast beef and turkey is a great combo
 - earl mustard makes sandwich even better
Italian:
 - an awesome hearty sandwich
 - very bold and savory pizza-like taste

All of the sandwiches come on their special artisan baked loaf which reminded me of a lighter more luscious ciabatta."
9962,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I wish I would've gotten a few extra slices but since there was an employee slicing it I was a bit shy to ask for more.
9963,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Mexican station - 3.5\/5 not bad, taco station is good, elote is yum, the other stuff was just ok.

American food station - 3.5\/5 - fried chicken is good but a bit too much (1\/2 size would be great), meatloaf is good, mac n cheese is good (would be great if they have substantial bread crumb crust), veggies are all delicious (carrots, asparagus, snap peas)."
9964,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"escargot was good too, don't forget to dip bread in the sauce :)

try to get patio seating if possible, great views of bellagio fountain show."
9965,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Their seafood is absolutely the freshest, no hint of fishy, frozen or off taste or smell."
9966,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Seriously, I made like a bat and virtually consumed my own body weight in a single feeding*, most of it comprising of miniature flans and creme brulees."
9967,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Amazing food and wonderful service.
9968,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The Buffet at the Wynn (delicious, wide variety, awesome atmosphere but price point is high and the wait can be ridiculous)

4."
9969,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The food is pretty good it fills the bill, desserts are their forte."
9970,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"We started off with a full carafe of frangria, their twist on sangria, which was a wonderful  blend of fruit and alcohol."
9971,QUALITY#POSITIVE,What a wonderful way to say Happy Birthday to my tastebuds\/stomach...they also brought out  complimentary profiterole with vanilla ice cream!
9972,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I think I was expecting more artful presentation and exotic flavors; I got some good flavors and generic presentation.
9973,QUALITY#POSITIVE,It was the perfect combination of flavor.
9974,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The selections and quality was delicious and amazing as we saw in Las Vegas.
9975,QUALITY#POSITIVE,My favorite sandwich in the whole wide wonderful world!
9976,QUALITY#POSITIVE,They have a very basic selection of food- but better!
9977,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The Ginseng chicken soup is heavily loaded with good stuff.
9978,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The roasted chestnut soup, creamed cauliflower and seared scallops were real standouts."
9979,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Prime Rib sandwich was good.
9980,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Not nearly as cool or fun of a presentation, but definitely a better burger."
9981,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The pork belly was juicy & delicious, They did not have too many options for desserts, just your standards, I tried almost one of everything but was only happy with the keylime tart."
9982,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"They are fresh, and high quality, but other buffets for $10 or $20 cheaper will have the similar seafood as well."
9983,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I adored the shrimp cocktail, and I had 2 full plates of it; the cocktail sauce decently surprised me."
9984,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Also, it means you can get a lot more plates because only 3 or 4 little dishes fit on a plate :)

Overall, food was fresh, dessert was good, and the waiters taking your drink orders were very helpful (who's importance is definitely not to be underestimated!)."
9985,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"That's not the bad part of the experience, the food was great but they were not the best."
9986,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Yes they have some intriguing and great items here.
9987,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food was really good though.
9988,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food is always fresh and all items are always filled.
9989,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I usually don't like it at most places because they taste too bready - but Mon Ami Gabi does a good job in capturing the moist texture in their French Toast.
9990,QUALITY#POSITIVE,My stomach was sufficiently full at the end of the meal.
9991,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Normally, I don't expect much when I order fruit at a restaurant, but all the fruit were ripe and perfect as well."
9992,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Prime rib was great, the various Asian selections were a highlight, and the dessert bar is enormous."
9993,QUALITY#POSITIVE,What did have us in awe were the truffle parmesean fries.
9994,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I just like the cleanliness and decor, and you can taste the quality in the food."
9995,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I will make the exception because this place is truly in a league of it's own because of how far the taste and quality exceeds that of any other Thai restaurant I have been to in the United States.
9996,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The crispy rice was a wonderful texture with the meat and ginger sauce.
9997,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Order the northern cuisine people!
9998,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Salads
Asian\/Noodles\/Sushi\/Dim Sum
Desserts\/Ice Cream\/Sorbet

Seriously, pace yourself so you can eat everything."
9999,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The American burger was also really good - simple and delicious.
10000,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I love fried rice, I love duck, I really enjoy the Tom yum Soup."
10001,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Both were cooked perfectly tender, with a delicious red wine reduction on top, although the steaks really didn't need any embellishment."
10002,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Spicy and tons of flavor, I think the best part was how it completely cured my hangover."
10003,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I haven't been to a Vegas buffet in a long time, yet I can say I was very satisfied with this meal."
10004,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Consistently delicious, fresh food."
10005,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The french toast log is literally a LOG and I would eat it everyday if it didn't take me 3 days to eat it (yup, it's still good after 3 days!)."
10006,QUALITY#POSITIVE,-Dessert was good.
10007,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"From the taste to the presentation, this is a foodie's heaven."
10008,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Didn't have a meal there, but we did see a few dishes that looked really good (like the foot long steak and eggs sandwich which was served open face - WOW!)."
10009,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I got the sage chicken (because it was featured on MvF) and it didn't disappoint.
10010,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Great bread, quality meats."
10011,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The snails were tender (note that they do not serve these in-shell -- most snails don't really come in their shells, anyway -- they're usually re-placed in re-usable shells just for presentation)."
10012,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Everything was cooked right and tasted great .
10013,QUALITY#POSITIVE,:) they have a gelato bar INSIDE the buffet... their waffle cone is very tasty!
10014,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Since the restaurant is so versatile it's hard to recommend 1 or 2 dishes in particular so it's probably best to list the highlights by meal:
Breakfast: Croque Madame or the Quiche Lorraine."
10015,QUALITY#POSITIVE,It wasn't too much liquid which can happen quite often with this type of sandwich.
10016,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I also love their prime ribs and desert selection.
10017,QUALITY#POSITIVE,the shrimp ceviche was unique and tasty.
10018,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"It's a creditable Thai restaurant, and they certainly serve some of the best Thai food I've had since San Francisco's Thep Phanom took its nosedive into mediocrity."
10019,QUALITY#POSITIVE,French onion soup and open face shrimp salad sandwhich was good.
10020,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I started talking to the waitress and she said that the reason why the food was so fresh is that they make a trip to LA TWICE a week to get fresh ingredients for their dishes.
10021,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The desserts all looked delicious, and most of the ones I tasted (with the exception of the sugar free ones...but I guess that was my fault) were great."
10022,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food was very tasty and reasonably portioned.
10023,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I did have an amazing shrimp dish in a little pot with red sauce and cheese, but I have no idea what it was because there was no placard."
10024,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Last time I was in Vegas, I brought home 10 sandwiches back home for friends and family to try, and after sitting in the car for 4 hours... it still tasted amazing!"
10025,QUALITY#POSITIVE,We had the bacon avocado burger and corned beef sandwich night one and the chicken and waffles night two - everything we tried was amazing.
10026,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The tacos were surprisingly good and the salsa bar which had guac was on point for a buffet.
10027,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Its quite fluffy in texture; just like a croissant, it has a few layers."
10028,QUALITY#POSITIVE,All three dishes had the right balance in taste.
10029,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The skin was not too thick or dry, especially sitting on a buffet line."
10030,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I was a little disappointed with the lack of options but we had the banana shake and it was fantastic.
10031,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Pros were the beef ribs (fresh cut at the Prime Rib station), and actually, the mushroom polenta (though admittedly, I'm a sucker for mushroom dishes)."
10032,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Great food, atmosphere, service, etc."
10033,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The crabcake sandwich that my friend had was pretty good though... 30 minute on what appeared to be a restaurant with plenty of open seating, which was somewhat frustrating, but that's Vegas..."
10034,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The waffles were crisp, and the bacon inside added a good meaty taste, I was wondering why IHOP doesn't do that too."
10035,QUALITY#POSITIVE,the meditteranean chicken salad was fresh and complimented the sandwich well.
10036,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I like the Asian foods in the back.
10037,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Their salad and other items were good too and just as everyone else has said, if you sit in the patio you can see the Bellagio fountains!"
10038,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I was somewhat surprised that my least favorite options were the meats- the beef, pork, chicken- all lackluster compared to the seafood and veggie options."
10039,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Granted I had been at the clubs before stopping in for a sandwich but it definitley hit the spot.
10040,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Basically it's the food you see at fancy expensive restaurants, but all in one place at the buffet."
10041,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Food was YUM!
10042,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"We did have to wait a good amount of time for our food...but, the waiter explained that when we placed our order it would take a lil while since what we ordered was made fresh...kinda makes the wait bearable...and I had the St. Mimosa with OJ instead of grapefruit  juice and it was SUPERFANTASICAL."
10043,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food was excellent as was the presentation.
10044,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Tillamook is good, but they could definitely improve the cheese selection."
10045,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The service was great, atmosphere was great, and the food....yum, FANTASTIC!"
10046,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The Merlot reduction was done so perfect and paired excellent with the whole meal.
10047,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Service is mediocre, decor pretty mundane and the location kind of creepy but the food more than makes up for it."
10048,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"There is nothing mind blowing about this place, however they have better than average steaks and seafoods along with with their sandwiches."
10049,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Biting into the shell was like biting into a crispier version of chicharron ( crispy pig skin).
10050,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The menu had lots of delicious-sounding options, but I settled on the seafood crepe while my friend ordered the open-face shrimp salad sandwich with avocado."
10051,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Steak Bordelaise- A london broil cut of beef should not taste this good...Mon Ami does wonderful things with their steaks!
10052,QUALITY#POSITIVE,They have a pasta bar and their dessert bar is great too!
10053,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"With each chew, the juice oozed out from the fibers and the filet was so soft and tender that it literally melted like butter in my mouth (similar to a fine wagyu minus the richness)."
10054,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Fast, fresh, reasonably priced, and consistently YUMMY!"
10055,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I am a corned beef fanatic and it definitely hit the spot.
10056,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I was not disappointed by the authenticity, polite service & delicious complexity of flavors!!"
10057,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Wow great service and food.
10058,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Friendly, attentive staff and delicious food."
10059,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The other because the food just was not five star worthy, but it is a good burger."
10060,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I really loved their thin crust Caprese pizza, it was really good and the cheese they use is absolutely orgasmically good!!"
10061,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Salmon was cooked perfectly and the dressing was mild and good.
10062,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The food is still top quality, which makes it all that much more disappointing to wait."
10063,QUALITY#POSITIVE,All of their sandwiches are hot and use high quality ingredients.
10064,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Both were amazing, rich French deliciousness."
10065,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Their thick steak fries are amazing (and I prefer thinner ones) and come with tasty different ketchups, including a chipotle and a curry choice."
10066,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The restaurant is incredible decor food amazing .
10067,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Almost every food tastes amazing and allows you to experience the flavor you've never been exposed to.
10068,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Always consistently delicious and good service.
10069,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I love the type of buns they use and they were sooooo good.
10070,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"When the food came out, my quiche looked fluffy and delicious."
10071,QUALITY#POSITIVE,There's a noodle soup station with pretty decent bowls of pho!
10072,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The food stations were clean unlike last time and each one was full of selections of fresh, tasty goodies."
10073,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The baked goat cheese appetizer was truly an unforgettable dish.
10074,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Overall the food is good.
10075,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The sweetness was just right as it was not overly sweet.
10076,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food and atmosphere somewhat made up for the poor service and seating we were given.
10077,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The waffle, on the other hand was good, except the little tin cup of syrup was placed on the waffle itself."
10078,QUALITY#POSITIVE,this must of been one of the most tenderest steaks i have ever eaten in my life!
10079,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"-  The items in the bamboo steamers are delicious, but watch out because the steam will sting your hand!"
10080,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"This place has one of the best steaks in Las Vegas for the price, whenever I have someone visiting from out of town this is on my list of places I have to take them, the view on the patio is absolutely breathtaking and you'll catch the Bellagio fountains at least a couple times during your dinner which is fantastic if you aren't used to them, but the best part about this place is definitely the steak I highly recommend the peppercorn one I order it every time and it is absolutely amazing!"
10081,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The sandwiches are okay, nothing special, only good thing about this place is that it is open 24 hours and the sandwiches are made fresh."
10082,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"All of their food is good, literally."
10083,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Pink Lemonade:  Err it wasn't pink but it tasted good.
10084,QUALITY#POSITIVE,i'm a local and had never been so when out of town guests came to visit i figured i'd give it a shot - it was great all three times i was there (within a 2 week period) had lunch - croque monseiur (i'm sure i spelled it wrong) which is a french grilled ham and cheese - yummy!
10085,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Overall, 5 stars for food and drinks, 5 stars for service, 5 stars for cleanliness and 5 stars for environment and decoration."
10086,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"This is from my experience on 10\/18\/2016

3 stars for lack of quality of service, attitudes of people working on the property, but the food was worth the exorbitant cost."
10087,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Hands down best Thai food in North America!
10088,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food I had was amazing and the presentation was outstanding.
10089,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Delicious food and very large portions!
10090,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"They have a lot interesting dishes like their special crispy duck in curry (good but the dish is very heavy for 2 to share- plus the crispiness of the duck disappears once it has soaked long enough in the curry), kao soi (curry noodle), garlic shrimp (fried shrimp with shells on- which I am not quite a fan on)."
10091,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"If I could eat like this every day...

Las Vegas has a few things to offer, gambling, food, and unusual sights."
10092,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"They had creme brulee which is my favorite, sorbets, candy, cookies, and your typical desserts, but on another level."
10093,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Service was great and our dishes were delicious.
10094,QUALITY#POSITIVE,My god they make the best club sandwiches!
10095,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Compare with Makino Seafood Buffet in Vegas or Irvine, their oyster & crab leg even better than here!!!"
10096,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The flavors are spot on and you can tell that they take pride in what they serve.
10097,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Huge variety, selection, freshness!"
10098,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"For our apps, drinks and meals, here's what we had:

Chateau Laronde Desormes Bordeaux for $54 a bottle - This wine was on point!"
10099,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Too much to choose from, as always at a buffet, but still good food to help your hangover headache."
10100,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Interior: signs and many awards of the glorious food.
10101,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Although, I do wish they had more seafood options, the food was definitely spectacular!"
10102,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The desserts were good but I think the Rio or Bellagio buffets have better choices.
10103,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"As with many buffets, the food run the gambit from classic American fare like your mini burgers, fries and mac & cheese, to Mexican, to Chinese, and again, everything worked quite well."
10104,QUALITY#POSITIVE,It's seriously THAT good!
10105,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Pros - French toast, eggs, and bacon."
10106,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I thought the sushi was good and fresh, nothing special about it was they were just the california roll types."
10107,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The perfect combination of crispy and bready-ness without being overpowering over the entire sandwich as a whole.
10108,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I sampled all the pretty looking ones, and the flavor is amazing."
10109,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I had duck confit ravioli, tomato risotto, a scalloped GENEROUSLY truffled potato dish, chocolate lava cake, macarons, mango sorbet - a lot of stuff that is unique or HARD to pull off in large quantities."
10110,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I enjoyed the crab legs, kimchi fried rice, carnitas nacho, and the dessert bar!"
10111,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"and oh, the first bite...heavenly."
10112,QUALITY#POSITIVE,We were choking down the wonderful food because we couldn't get a refill of our drinks.
10113,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Had a chicken, bacon, avocado wrap from here for dinner after the flight in as I didn't want something heavy, and well I will definitely be coming back here again for the same wrap, was so fresh and tasty"
10114,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I felt their desserts were lacking a bit though but the seafood was really delicious and fresh.
10115,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"And, it was hella good."
10116,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Mon garçon Francois laid the Gallic charm on pretty thick, but did it with a self-aware smile that was completely disarming."
10117,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food was great...
10118,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food was so amazing!
10119,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"the prices for the meals are pretty high, but then again it is quality food you will be receiving as compared to other all you can eat restaurants with lower standards to food preparation."
10120,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"It's like a must to stop by and pick up a sandwich from here when I'm in town and every single time, my sandwiches taste so ridiculously good!"
10121,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I tried their smoked brisket - super tender and well seasoned like some authentic Texas BBQ, prime rib (a bit too bloody for my liking I should have let the carver know), and beef ribs were tender but still had to use your teeth to pull the meat cleanly off the bone which is perfect so it's not parboiled first."
10122,QUALITY#POSITIVE,This guy recommended our tangerine mimosas and they were awesome!
10123,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Awesome buffet, crab legs and chocolate eclairs are the tits."
10124,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"It's noodles in a curry sauce, almost like a soup 

Tom Kah Kai - $4.95 cup - the best darn soup ever!!!"
10125,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I suggest going with an empty stomach, eating slowly and attempting to try all (or most) of the food- good luck!"
10126,QUALITY#POSITIVE,My friends got the flapper jacks in the banana flavor and that was so good.
10127,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Salad greens very fresh.
10128,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Then mango sticky rice desert put us over the top.
10129,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Delicious and elegant French restaurant in Vegas right on the strip.
10130,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Surprisingly good quality!
10131,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Over all, good flavors, small-ish portions, in-attentive service."
10132,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Their steaks are the best!
10133,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I have had chicken and waffles, but this was by far the best I have had."
10134,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"We then had some dim sum (very very good), Ribs, mac and cheese, Jamaican beef patties, crab, mussels, you name it it's there!!"
10135,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The food seemed to be of high quality, but in order to get your money's worth you need to come on an empty stomach"
10136,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Almost every benedict I get at a restaurant has over-cooked poached eggs, but these were nice and runny."
10137,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The steaks were perfect and the service was also perfect.
10138,QUALITY#POSITIVE,And the food...it was delicious!!
10139,QUALITY#POSITIVE,i didn't eat at all of them :( but of all the ones i did eat at this is the only one we ate at twice!
10140,QUALITY#POSITIVE,This is a good place to eat at if you don't have a car to get off of the strip to find cheaper food.
10141,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Either way, we definitely enjoyed our steaks."
10142,QUALITY#POSITIVE,My friend ordered the Mac n' cheese and she immediately got food poisoning.
10143,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"both times and I tasted it, it was good."
10144,QUALITY#POSITIVE,They have so much flavor and the dipping sauces are good too.
10145,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Delicious, and even though there is another location in anaheim, 30 minutes from my home, I always think of getting this sandwich when I am back in Vegas."
10146,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"2 Great items must try...
Prime Rib -- much better than your average buffet, though not fair to compare to high end steak houses ok.
Crab legs -- though cold it was fresh and sweet & plumb served with drawn butter

Other items were pretty standard buffet fare."
10147,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The roast beef was thick and juicy, the sandwich sauce was savory, and the bread was toasted to a chewy perfection."
10148,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The seafood area had the longest line but you could see that the food was fresh.
10149,QUALITY#POSITIVE,They have a HUGE selection of food choices and they taste good !
10150,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Service was good, food was good, if it was not in Vegas it would not be as packed."
10151,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Pad Woonsen with several ingredients and our three types of protein was a fine, satisfying dish."
10152,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food was good and very big portions.
10153,QUALITY#POSITIVE,For a buffet the food is as good as it gets.
10154,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I'm such a fan and it's the simple foods that show how they get it right.
10155,QUALITY#POSITIVE,And they were good.
10156,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I felt the food was kept fresh and replenished often, I enjoyed seeing the staff behind the food as I could ask questions, get recommendations etc... One of the things I liked best was the small size of certain dishes - enough for a bite or two which encouraged me to try lots of things I may not have tasted otherwise."
10157,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Do stick with the restaurant recommendations\/specials because some of the other dishes (tom yum soup, papaya salad) are standard and taste like you could get them from any other Thai restaurant in America."
10158,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I had four types of curried dishes on my plate at once and they all had unique flavor.
10159,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I had  one of the spicy chicken wraps, which was actually spicy, and fresh."
10160,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The food stayed warm, the seafood was fresh, and there is every station you can think of!"
10161,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I enjoyed the cheeses, especially the blue which had a bit of a spicy bite."
10162,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"We ordered the Salmon entree and the Seafood crepe, both plates were absolutely divine."
10163,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Shakes are really unique and delicious.
10164,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"All the other coffee, caramel, toffee, and etc flavors were good too :) Watermelon mint is simply the most refreshing for me after a massive ginormous meal!"
10165,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The bao (chinese steamed bun) is pretty much like the ones you get when you order the peking duck platter at a Chinese restaurant.
10166,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"If you're in Vegas and you can't win big at the slots or the tables, then go here, because with a spread like this, everyone wins."
10167,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Of course this place serves your tradition crab legs ( always good ) and prime rib ( above average ) .
10168,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Compared to similar sandwiches from other restaurants, this one is far better but there was nothing about this one that stuck out or made it special like the other sandwiches."
10169,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"This is such a blatant rip off that I am inclined to shake my head at Gordon and give him one of my own ""such a shame"" mutterings, but yes, it was indeed a very good burger."
10170,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"You do pay more since it is a higher end buffet, but I think its worth it because of  the variety  of the selection and quality of food."
10171,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I had a veggie pizza and it was wonderful!
10172,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Indonesian curries , prime rib , etc.....sushi was surprisingly fresh for a buffet."
10173,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"everything here is presented ""cutely"" which makes the food looks good, however it actually tasted good."
10174,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Came here for lunch with my husband earlier this year (Around April) when we visited Vegas... delicious food and great ambiance.
10175,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"the farm burger was really good but I wished they had a side or the option of lettuce, onion and tomatoes.."
10176,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"lotus is the best, great food and service - proves quality will always will over location"
10177,QUALITY#POSITIVE,We had several things that we shared and there was not one thing we were not salivating over after we were done.
10178,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Lotus of Siam has really great tasting Thai food plus an excellent selection of wine.
10179,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Everything was delicious, I loved the desserts they were amazing!"
10180,QUALITY#POSITIVE,We ate at TOM's URBAN before for earlier dinner which had A WAY BETTER BURGER for same price !
10181,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Prime rib was okay, but the mango jalepeno chicken sausage was good."
10182,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Thought it was pretty good.
10183,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The chicken burger was very good - the highlight of the meal (along with the house made ketchup).
10184,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"eggs bennedict was better than Bachannal and I was pleasantly surprised to find bone marrow here, which was quite tasty, along with the ""wicked"" juice."
10185,QUALITY#POSITIVE,It's some of the best food I have ever eaten!
10186,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Prime rib is also good if you are meat lover.
10187,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"the value, the bang for your buck, the delicious delicious food."
10188,QUALITY#POSITIVE,They've got all kinds of food and the best part about it is the quality of the food.
10189,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Keep in mind, the food is very tasty and that is why I'm still giving it an A-OK rating but the portion sizes are seriously offensive."
10190,QUALITY#POSITIVE,We shared the Yardbird sandwich which reminds me of a traditional chicken sandwich with amped up ingredients.
10191,QUALITY#POSITIVE,They've really raised the bar on buffet food quality.
10192,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Still freaking awesome and the crab legs are still split in half for you!
10193,QUALITY#POSITIVE,There is an assortment of green and red peppers in the pile hence making it a very exotic dish.
10194,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Here is a list of some of my favorite things on the buffet:   flank steak, carved turkey,  corn bread topped w\/ BBQ and coleslaw."
10195,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Nonetheless, the buffet offered a lot of high quality food."
10196,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"you can also drive 15 minutes off the strip to a much lovelier location, had the Benedict at both and found them of an equally delicious nature, and the service and ambiance were excellent in both locations too."
10197,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I only got to try the tuna tartar which was delicious, and my cousins were very happy with their choice of the seafood platter."
10198,QUALITY#POSITIVE,We were very impressed with this presentation and preparation.
10199,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Creme Brulee had a nice texture and wasn't too sweet.
10200,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Decor was pretty bad - bright lights and in a strip mall but had a great table and really delicious food.
10201,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"More selection, nicer ambiance, better quality."
10202,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I highly recommend this restaurant not only for the food but also for the great service and great price!
10203,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Not only that, it had the perfect crusty exterior and soft, chewy interior."
10204,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The prime rib was really good too--juicy and not over-cooked.
10205,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"3rd plate: A plate of bowls: Beet salad which was very tasty and flavorful (I could eat a small bowl of it), caprese salad was very good(I was surprised to taste that the mozzarella was as fresh as it was), baked Mac and cheese was damn good(not to feeling, just the right portion, very cheesy with a bit of a spice kick), fried chicken wings, lightly breaded, not to greasy and juicy (these wings put the restaurants that specialize in wings to shame)."
10206,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Don't forget to also try the Caprese sandwich which was very tasty in its own right.

10209,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The Full Montague, the Earl's Club... You should try them all at least once."

10265,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Quantity AND quality.

10267,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Seafood, meats were so damn tasty."
10268,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I ordered Trout Almondine and while it tasted good, it looked sparse, had a few scattered almonds on top of a lightly sauted fish, and unlike most I have had."
10269,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I have to say that when I took a bite into my burger I could taste the delicious taste of the grill and then I tasted all the flavors coming together so beautifully!
10270,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The service and food was incredible.
10271,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"They had made to order soup section... Got the tonkotsu ramen which was the best ramen I've gotten in buffet standard, although it got a lil salty towards the end."

10286,QUALITY#POSITIVE,There is also italian and asian and mexican and most things are cooked to order.
10287,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The loaf of bread served with meal was AMAZING- hot and crusty on the outside, soft on the inside and truly yummy."
10288,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Cute and classy interior, amazing bread in the beginning, the escargot (which I told myself years ago I would never ever eat) was to die for, and just everything was delish."
10289,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"i'd say between the two i had, the holiday turkey sandwich was my favorite because it was just so clever\/original to have turkey, gravy, stuffing, and cranberry sauce all stuffed into a sandwich."
10290,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I highly recommend having the Nutella coffee ice cream since it combines two of my favorite flavors.
10291,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Fresh salami and mortadella and proscuitto :) And there were fresh cheeses too - my fave: Smoked Gouda :) 
Being the cheap-o asian at heart, I came here on a Sunday at 2:00 pm so that I could pay Brunch price and at 3:30 dinner items start to roll out :) That means MORE variety and MORE dessert selections!"
10292,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The asian food was excellent you would have thought they had a Chinese cook on staff.
10293,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Who would have thought you could have a wonderful French dinner right on the Strip at a reasonable price in a casino?
10294,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Bc once you get your meal it's a feast of home cooked comfort food overload.
10295,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"This isn't to say that the number of offerings has diminished or the quality has gone down, although I will point out that the custom mac and cheese station now has far fewer choices and desserts seem to have more duplication across the space than before."
10296,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The tibs were huge and both items were tender and had great flavor!
10297,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Service was nice and food was great.
10298,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Bananas Foster Crepe has be the BEST dessert in the city.
10299,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The four heavy waffles included in the meal had bacon slices cooked in it which was nice but really if I didn't see it while eating it, I wouldn't have even noticed it was there since the waffle itself over powered it in flavor."
10300,QUALITY#POSITIVE,A wonderland of food.
10301,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"But I do want some roughage when I'm cannibalizing on a fresh, juicy piece of french duck in America's city of excess."
10302,QUALITY#POSITIVE,It's the bread that makes this place so awesome.

10310,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Good price great food.
10311,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Lotus of Siam has made me a Pad See Ew snob, ever since that first time I ate here, the quality and technique that is executed here is so superb; I honestly have to remind myself that it's not supposed to be this good!"
10312,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I don't know if they always have the same stuff, but the home made marshmallows and meringues were delicious."
10313,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The buffets and fine dining on the strip are great, but the Thai food here is what I must eat every time I visit."
10314,QUALITY#POSITIVE,All the seafood items tasted fresh.
10315,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The flavors are authentic Thai - you can taste and smell the fish sauce and the kaffir lime leaf and the birds eye chilis.
10316,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Everything is well-prepared with high quality ingredients.
10317,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"They have the most yummy selection of meats, pastas, seafoods, salads, and desserts!"

10323,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Coffee is incredible and the service was impeccable.
10324,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"On the other hand, the American-style foods, like the fried chicken and roasted bone marrow and salmon with pea puree, were quite excellent."
10325,QUALITY#POSITIVE,What the restaurant lacks in ambience and location it more than makes up for in food quality and menu.
10326,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The desserts were the best part of my meal.
10327,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"FYI- they only serve crepes for dinner, so after 3:30pm."
10328,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Awesome selection of food, hip looking seating area, and delicious desserts."
10329,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Bread - This place isn't like other sandwich shops in the regard that you only get one type of bread, GOOD BREAD!!!"
10330,QUALITY#POSITIVE,All food portions were HUGE but the Benedict was crazy large and packed with flavor on every bite.
10331,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"food was okay, nothing spectacular."
10332,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I loved their sweet potato tots, steamed crab, Japanese ramen, dim sum...well I basically loved it all...Oh, and I loved the drink selection they had right by the fried food with fresh HORCHATA, pineapple juice, and many more in these cute, individual glass jars (it's the little things!)"
10333,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"It was thick and chunky, but not too thick where it had the consistency of porridge ( a red flag for me to send it away )."
10334,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The Gordon burger was good with the same duck bacon.
10335,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food was perfectly seasoned and everything was quite fresh.
10336,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The quality was great, fresh and on point with the flavor."
10337,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Dessert selection was impressive and delicious
10338,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"At this point I was as excited as Homer in a donut factory, with the donuts being plates of fine cuisine in my case!"
10339,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"This was pretty good, I waited in line for 60 min and it was worth the wait!"
10340,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Some people say this place is overrated, however the food here is yummy."
10341,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"If you've ever eaten at a University lunch or dinner room, it's basically one of those tell-a-guy-to-make-awesome-things stations, albeit with better quality ingredients (I particularly appreciate the inclusion of feta and steak), but it's really nothing extraordinary."
10342,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food:  The food was delicious.
10343,QUALITY#POSITIVE,All kinds of varieties and pretty much everything we eat is great!
10344,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I tried the hog burger which had juicy, tender beef with a hint of sweetness."
10345,QUALITY#POSITIVE,It's such a tasty burger topping trio (say that 3 times fast).
10346,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The juices are strong and the meat is fresh.
10347,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Overall the quality of the individual items are pretty good, but the selection is kind of a turn off if you are really looking for that."
10348,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Quality is very good.
10349,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Of course Bacchanal made their sweet potato fries to perfection.
10350,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The croissant was okay (only took a bite), the brûlée good, but the tiramisu was excellent!"
10351,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Anyway, tasty food and glad to finally have tried the Frozen Hot Chocolate (a slushy chocolate milk topped with whipped cream), but good, efficient, and friendly service would make the experience better."
10352,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Both dishes were fried to perfection and had wonderful balance in flavor.
10353,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Plus, it was the right amount of spice."
10354,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The Good - crab legs, side dishes like the tater tots, truffle potato, lamb chops, gelato"
10355,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I enjoyed all my plates and dessert was delicious with lots of variety .
10356,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Yeah, this is definitely one of the good buffets out there with beautiful decor and simplicity of food items while executed well with good flavors."
10357,QUALITY#POSITIVE,It's so delicious and still really reasonably priced.
10358,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The prime rib was tender and I believe it to be prime quality as opposed to choice.
10359,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food was not salty like most buffets that I've been to.
10360,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The chocolate was good.
10361,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Few things that stood out for me:

Angry Mac n Cheese - It has a hint of a spicy flavoring and not ridiculously cheesy."
10362,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Garlic prawns are amazing, as are whole fish dishes of various preparations."
10363,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"We are not talking about some poorly copied Subway knockoff, we are talking about a quaint little store, filled with personality, AND filled to the brim with people enjoying their customized, fresh, made in front of you sandwiches."
10364,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The corn dogs were hot and fresh.
10365,QUALITY#POSITIVE,i dont usually order or care too much for onion rings but these ones are so damn good.
10366,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Good service with interesting varieties of delicious food.
10367,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The workers have great customer service the food was awesome !
10368,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"My husband is a chef, so pleasing him and 10 of his closest chef buddies is a hard task and yet everyone seemed to really enjoy all of the offerings."
10369,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Husband and I both ordered a burger, however we shared fries which was good because the portion was huge."
10370,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The rack of lamb lollipops were definitely the highlight of the meal.
10371,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The quality and taste are spectacular.
10372,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I have yet to be disappointed by any meal I've had here.
10373,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Their raw seafood bar is the most impressive of all (among Ballagio, Wynn and Wicked Spoon)."
10374,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"What we got: yum x 1000, great service, great food, great efficiency, clean bathrooms, bright ambience (inside at least), okay parking and a fantastic experience all around."
10375,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The melted Gouda cheese on top had the rich flavor I was looking for but the sauce was not overpowering.
10376,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Lines can get long but staff is super efficient and the sandwiches are worth the wait.
10377,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The desserts were off the charts good!
10378,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"So it was pretty tasty, but I couldn't help but have a mental image of an ostrich with his head buried in the ground."
10379,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Food dishes ordered:

Apps:
Chicken Satay 
Wontons  (these were ok. Had nice flavor but needed more meat)
Cup of non-spicy veggie soup (ok, needed more flavor)

Meals:
Chicken fried rice
Chow mein 
Pad Thai
Pad Woonsen 
Sticky rice

Or main meal was awesome."
10380,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I also recommend any of the cocktails, the steaks, the frites, the after dinner coffees, desserts, all of it."
10381,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I know it's simple but the chicken noodle soup is a must try.
10382,QUALITY#POSITIVE,So much brunch foods to choose from and they were ALL yummy and very great quality!
10383,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Come for only the fresh seafood (crab legs) and dessert.
10384,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I recommend the firecracker Mac n cheese and bread pudding and other things you may not normally try like bone marrow.
10385,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The sushi isn't spectacular, but it is good for a buffet."
10386,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"There was a lot of variety, all organized neatly, and many of the items were quite delicious."
10387,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The hummus was great, though came with some weird veggies to dip with such as green onions?"
10388,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The cheddar cheese and sweet spicy horseradish sauce complimented the tender beef perfectly.
10389,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The best thai food EVER.
10390,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The second time my bf and I said, ""Let's give the place another try since the food was outstanding."""
10391,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I had the Sage Chicken Benny, or thought I did... the first time they brought it out without the chicken... presentation was nice and flavors were great."
10392,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The quality of the sushi was much better than Bacchanal Buffet; the maki rolls here were actually tasty and didn't have too much rice.
10393,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food was so parisian that the strip could have been replaced by the Champs +D'Eleyse.
10394,QUALITY#POSITIVE,They had macaroons that rivaled the quality in some French bakeries I've visited--and six different kinds!
10395,QUALITY#POSITIVE,It's the most perfectly poached egg with the most amazing hollandaise sauce over a mouthwatering slice of ham and a sourdough muffin you'll ever put in your mouth!
10396,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"There was a wonderful assortment of good quality, fresh food and next time we are in Vegas we will definitely be back!"
10397,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The Brussels Sprouts were great as well, but I may have I counted but 11 halves, which sadly calculates to nearly a buck a sprout."
10398,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Wow....what a great experience....the best thing ever was the crab legs in hot soup....service was outstanding....the place was sooooooooooooo clean too!!!
10399,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I had the chicken and biscuit entree and it was so flavorful and reminded me of a holiday meal with my family.
10400,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Anyway, I can't really come to a burger place and complain about their chicken burgers :) Everyone in my group who got an ACTUAL burger (beef)  loved it."
10401,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Bad location the garnish ruins the meal there's  no restrooms inside the restaurant 


Great music and fun environment  AMAZING BLOODY MARY'S BUT THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE SUCks bC OF THE LOCATION I would not go back"
10402,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"YUM :) the hell's kitchen burger had a nice spicy kick to it and I think it would've been even better if it were a bit spicier ;) The britannia had mango chutney in it, and although I'm someone who doesn't like ""fruit"" in a salty dish, this was delicious!"
10403,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"As many reviewers have mentioned, the highlights are the seafood and the prime rib, but that wasn't all that was good: the Kobe beef burger, the gelato ice cream, the made to order tacos all stood out in my opinion."
10404,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Food is very good.
10405,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The Cannonball was my kind of meatball sandwich, the bread-fresh!, meatballs-hearty!, marianara-tasty!"
10406,QUALITY#POSITIVE,There is a wide selection of quality food.
10407,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The waffle cone itself tasted like a fortune cookie gone wrong.
10408,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Decent prices, drinks were good, burgers were great."
10409,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Food was great, service was good."
10410,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Namely: The onion rings; crispy, hot, salty, and a little bit spicy, the fried chicken, which was damn near perfect, the peach brisket, the meat and cheese section, and several of the deserts."
10411,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Everything on the menu is fabulous love the ambiance and the service is always superb.
10412,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Each dish was savory and the ingredients used were fresh.
10413,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Although the menu selection isn't as vast as most, the quality of the dishes are unparalleled by most vegas buffets."
10414,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"From spicy seafood noodles to fried pork and beef dishes, they are all delicious, but you won't find any of these in China."
10415,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Overall, fantastique food in decent portions & good prices, visually stunning and beautiful french vibe."
10416,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I tried the onion rings, which really are as good as people say."
10417,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The service does accompany the high quality of the cooking.
10418,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I'm not a souffle person but that was pretty darn good.
10419,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Each dish had a lot of flavor which complemented the seafood of choice.
10420,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I am a huge fan of Thai food and while it is always really delicious, I have never eaten Thai at a restaurant where I was blown away by the flavor, ingredients and innovation in traditional dishes."
10421,QUALITY#POSITIVE,There wasn't one person at my table that didn't enjoy their meal.
10422,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Anyway, you can't go wrong with the Northern Style Thom Kha Gai (item M on the Northern menu): amazingly light, fresh tasting, spicy and redolent of lemon grass, a perfect food I could gulp by the quart."
10423,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I mostly sampled pasta selections and they were decent.
10424,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"There were a lot of fresh salad items, which I really appreciated."
10425,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Unlike most Thai restaurants, they use a thinner and skinnier noodle which actually absorbs the peanut sauce a lot better because of the greater surface area AND it's chewey which deserves my love and affection."
10426,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The salmon poke was delicious and makes up for the lack of sashimi slices.
10427,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Spicy, chocolate, complex flavor that pleasantly lingers on the tongue."
10428,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Can't beat the great food and the view!
10429,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"If you love Sandwiches, you'll love this."
10430,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Vegas steakhouses can be some of the most expensive, but Mon Ami Gabi offered us a delicious meal at a price that we couldn't refuse."
10431,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"--Mexican station: Living in the Portland area where Mexican food generally sucks, I loved this section!"
10432,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Mon Ami clearly has a higher opinion of me, because their Stumptown coffee was deeeelightful."
10433,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I enjoyed the BEST French toast I've ever had along with a variety of other tasty items.
10434,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food was good but seemed like they had limited the helpings.
10435,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"And the garlic prawns were nice, but as someone else noted the portion was small in comparison to the price."
10436,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Crispy in some areas, a good chew in others."
10437,QUALITY#POSITIVE,They also had made to order tacos with a full toppings bar which I did try and the meat was flavorful.
10438,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Elegant location, scrumptious food, and superb service."
10439,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Also got the waffles hitch were so good, nice sweet treat!"
10440,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The food I'll go for 2nds, 3rds... even 4ths:
Shrimp Cocktail - jumbo shrimps with cocktail sauce that has a wasabi kick to it
Crab legs - cut in half to make going through plates of them a whole lot faster
Gelato - I tried Pistachio, Coffee and Mango... all great choices, especially with a waffle cone
Chocolate dipped strawberries - triple dipped BIG strawberries

10481,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The fresh squeezed orange juice was awesome when it got there, but the only other thing that really stood out was their awesome dessert island."
10482,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Everything was delicious, although they could offer some creamed horseradish rather than just the fresh horseradish at the cold seafood station."
10483,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The salads and fruit options are all fresh and in that same section, freshly carved deli meats are available as well....reminded me much of a charcuterie."
10484,QUALITY#POSITIVE,This is the best buffet in Vegas in terms of quality of food and customer service.
10485,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Some of the best buffet food I've had.
10486,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Not a big fan of the champagne and orange juice so I instead opted to order the bottomless beer  Yeee !!
10487,QUALITY#POSITIVE,They were light tasting breading wise and it was filled with cheese and bacon.
10488,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"So good in fact, that we ordered another to take as a leftover even though we had no other food left."

10495,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Dinner experience = amazing and the food definitely made up for the service in the beginning.
10496,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Blue Cheese - This version was like a spread and although it didn't evenly cover the patty all the time, it was amazingly flavorful and had a tang to it that toned down what would have been an overwhelmingly buttery meal."
10497,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The gambling, the casinos, the people, and most importantly, the food."
10498,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"And the drinks, they were always plentiful and delicious."
10499,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Some people at the table didn't like it because the sausage is sour, but its supposed to be."
10500,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I got the chicken Benedict, it was so good."
10501,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The oyster bar alone is worth is.
10502,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Small selection of sushi but the quality of the fish was great.
10503,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Hopefully, it does not fall into the trap of other celebrity chef-backed restaurants on The Strip where the quality standards drop as time goes on."
10504,QUALITY#POSITIVE,They also had the best pork friend rice I've ever eaten!
10505,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"They had amazing breads, vegetables, lasagna, pizzas, pastas, crab legs, lobster, shrimp, fruits, cheeses, caprese salads, ravioli's....the list goes on and on."
10506,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"1) Great service
2) Good and consistent food quality
3) Ambiance is great but keep in mind it is a cafe setting so it is a bit noisy
4) Reasonable pricing for Vegas center strip location
5) Beverage cost not blow up."
10507,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Delicious burgers, not the greasy type from the fast food restaurants that give you a heartburn, but a very delicate, tasty, creative ones that leave you feeling full, yet not overloaded."
10508,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I ordered the vegetarian Tom Yum (spicy vegetable soup) which was good!
10509,QUALITY#POSITIVE,These tiny concoctions truly are a delight to the eye as well as the tummy.
10510,QUALITY#POSITIVE,But anyhow aside from that service was great and the shakes even better.
10511,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I wasn't wowed with how tender or innovative the place is.
10512,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The lamb was good as well but sometimes people got pieces that were slightly overcooked or burned but overall good.
10513,QUALITY#POSITIVE,It's a buffet that offers quality food.
10514,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The selection and quality of Asian food was above some of the other high end buffets on the strip.
10515,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"We would say that the food was probably an 8\/10, with the desserts both being highlights."
10516,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The salad was great as well, but not really needed since we ordered so much food."
10517,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The sausage is great with all the fixings, too."
10518,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Later that night, went back to Earl's and bought two more tuna melts."
10519,QUALITY#POSITIVE,All these deliciousness is set in a gorgeous room very nicely decorated with beautiful flower arrangements and pastel colors.
10520,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"service was bad... waiter dissappeared and changed to another one without telling us 
food was delicious though... lots of meat cuts, king crabs... etcs
only good dessert that MUST have is creme burlee!!!!"
10521,QUALITY#POSITIVE,This place is very specific in their foods.
10522,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Besides from being a little awkward, that little room holds alot of yummy little goodies in there, pick wisely because before you know it you can end up like me with a plate full of goodies and feeling sick to my stomach just looking at them."
10523,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Yes it's not bacchanal and they stayed with more traditional choices for food and presentation but the quality was great for which is why it deserves 4 stars!
10524,QUALITY#POSITIVE,This place has great food period!
10525,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Salad was actually best part of meal.
10526,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"If you're open, you provide consistent quality of food throughout the day."
10527,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Most notably - the dessert - I don't even have a sweet tooth, but I'd say the dessert offerings alone warranted the price alone."
10528,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Please save room for dessert as their gelato bar is as good as any other gelato bar that you have to normally pay-per-scoop!
10529,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Everything had good flavor and service was excellent.
10530,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Went to the fried baskets and got the ""Chef's Special"" which was fried pickles, I do love me some fried pickles, kosher spears in a delightfully light batter, bar food, beer food, comfort food."
10531,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"My husband ordered the meatball flatbread pizza, and LOVED it."
10532,QUALITY#POSITIVE,He recommended the Pad Se Eww for the noodles and Charbroiled Beef in a Young Peppercorn Sauce.

10536,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Overall, the food is great n worth the price!"
10537,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"CHOCOLATE CONE yummy but the cone could be crunchier

There's a ton of salad to choose from, some sushi rolls (no nigiri), mac and cheese bar, truffle mashed potatoes, gelato station, fudge, OK I NEED TO GO BACK SO I can eat that stuff."
10538,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"All their herbs and spices are potent, they probably have their own garden outside."
10539,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Oh wait I have to mention one thing, they did have some scallop hat was the favorite of everyone."
10540,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I know we felt like pigs ... and didn't really care because we loved the food so much.
10541,QUALITY#POSITIVE,And don't forget to leave room for a plate or two of desserts.
10542,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Duck confit ravioli, KBBQ ribs (though not the best), mac and cheese bar, tiny portioned out salads, fried chicken, charcuterie station, and those random little dishes that have a different twist of flavors that you won't find at other buffets make me enjoy the difference here."
10543,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I did have a good solid meal....
10544,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I did notice a cheese station that was a nice touch and their mashed potatoes drizzled with truffle oil were AMAZING (I still think about them to this day!).
10545,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"For me, the stand out dishes were the pad thai and green chicken curry!"
10546,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The chicken sandwich had a nice big piece of chicken, but, it had the BBBQ sauce on it."
10547,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Best part of the buffet, other than the green tea, was a raw fuji apple."
10548,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"After eating at the Wynn, Caesar's Palace, and Bellagio I can honestly say that the food at Wicked Spoon is fresher\/more delicious and the presentation top notch."
10549,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Everything is pretty good here.
10550,QUALITY#POSITIVE,But good food coupled with great scenery does make for a fantastic breakfast experience.
10551,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"With what seems like an endless array of delicious food, Bacchanal comes out on top simply because of the quality AND quantity it serves."
10552,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"We ordered a carafe of sangria for the table (lovely) and a St. Germain's cocktail carafe (also lovely, but good in smaller portions, so thank goodness there were six of us)."
10553,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"- Sweet Potato Fries: Yummy and sweet but by the time I had been through the lines and got to eat it, it was cold ):
- Mac and Cheese: Why would I get mac n cheese at a 45-dollar buffet?"
10554,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Not a lot of variety in seafood at the time, just some salmon, shrimp cocktail, clams and sushi, but the meat was delicious."
10555,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Everything I ate was good.
10556,QUALITY#POSITIVE,-Italian Meatballs were my favorite!!!!
10557,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Theres also a place you can order outside if you dont feel like waiting

Once we sat down... our waiter was really nice and food came out pretty quick
I ended up getting the strip steak sandwich which was really good and i would for sure get again in the future

What topped it off was what there pretty much known for ... frozen hot chocolate!!!"
10558,QUALITY#POSITIVE,despite the long line and wait for the food.. my family and i still enjoyed our meal here.
10559,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I immediately took my food to my hotel room and the food was still hot and very fresh.
10560,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"My wife fell head over heels in love with the made-to-order fish soup, and yes, it was ridiculously delicious."

10569,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Dont kid yourself though, you will end up overeating as the food is really good  and made with quality ingredients."

10571,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Not like your average buffet quality.
10572,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Their prime rib was pretty tasty and my son loved the leg of lamb.
10573,QUALITY#POSITIVE,As a chef this is a for sure hit and a great way to experiment with your food.
10574,QUALITY#POSITIVE,All the food is fresh and amazing and the time they put into the attention to detail is fantastic!
10575,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"everything from Crab Legs, to more simple dishes like sweet potato fries, mashed potatos, sushi, bbq, tiny sliders that were unreal tender."
10576,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I can get a foot long at Subway for $5, but the taste of the sandwiches makes up for the cost and are probably proportionate portion sizes for what we should all eat for a sandwich."
10577,QUALITY#POSITIVE,We all know how long it takes to make the broth and Bacchanal is on point.
10578,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The bun was excellent, some kind of seed-y, doughy bread."
10579,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The prime beef and ribeye were decent.
10580,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"It was close to our hotel, offered bottomless brunch cocktails (for an extra $10 charge -- fair enough), super impressive selection, great quality of food and attentive service."
10581,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"For the quality of the food, and the overall atmosphere compared to other restaurants, the price was right!"
10582,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The French Onion soup is out of this world and comes in a huge crock.

10584,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Amazing service,  food was great!"
10585,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Fresh marmalade, cream on the side, and a lemon half to juice."
10586,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The other half ordered the chorizo hash and it was also really tasty.
10587,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"You know how some foods LOOK good, but then they don't TASTE good?"
10588,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Also had the breakfast trio which was refreshing and the classic breakfast w eggs, bacon, and hashbrown."
10589,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I mean, I get overly giddy over buffets anyways but this one just straight surpassed all my buffet dreams."
10590,QUALITY#POSITIVE,the sampling of items allows to try many of the delicious items without overeating.

10592,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The huge portions coupled with tasty food and reasonable pricing definitely sets this place apart.
10593,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The fried chicken in the basket was good.
10594,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Nevertheless, it's the food that keeps me coming back."
10595,QUALITY#POSITIVE,It was so over the top for a lunch buffet I had to post this.
10596,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Flavors are classic and no funky sauces to deal with.
10597,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Who knew a sandwich in Vegas could be this good?
10598,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The pricing is good for a sub shop and the food is tasty.
10599,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"My boyfriend also had some of the thanksgiving fare as well as some sliders, pizza and he really enjoyed the brisket."
10600,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The spicy raw fish salad (found next to the sushi in the Asian station) was fantastic: the kani and the hint of sesame seed oil was a great compliment to the freshness of the fish.
10601,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The waffles were good and had bacon in between which was a nice surprise.
10602,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Food:
Prime Rib - tender as ever can be
Lamb Racks - so much flavor
Oysters -  ehhh, but w\/e its oysters
Alaskan King Crab - so rich and succulent

Those were some of the main highlighted food at this buffet that I would eat for the rest of my life."
10603,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Stations include: a large dessert area with gelato, cookies, pastries, and chocolate covered strawberries; Asian station with tender Korean story short rib, freshly rolled sushi, and typical Chinese and Asian fare; a fresh fruit, cheeses, salads, and bread station; a live action station that serves custom order mac and cheese for dinner and omelets for brunch; a seafood and fish station; a Latin cuisine influenced section; and  an Italian pizza and pasta station that features delicious gnocchi, smoked ham infused macaroni and cheese, and butternut squash ravioli to die for."
10604,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The steak and fries are just wonderful here, and the service is attentive."
10605,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The eggs need a little bit more sauce, but only because of the richness of the yolks."
10606,QUALITY#POSITIVE,i discovered the dessert section and i already knew i would no longer fit into my clubbing dress.
10607,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Champagne is great, view of Bellagio fountains is amazing and the food and service is choice!"

10610,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"There were plenty of salads and sides to eat, and the vegan ice cream and cookies were excellent."
10611,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Prime rib was decent, and lamb was a little too gamey."
10612,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Prime rib - a bit too rare for my taste, but it's high quality and perfectly juicy.. not some cheap substituion 4 star

Ceviche - they have literally 5 finds, squid, mango glazed octopus, apple and other sauce soaked halibut, and some other ones I can't even remember."
10613,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"It's not the best, but it satisfies my cravings for all types of Asian foods."
10614,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I cannot describe how amazing the flavors were and how crispy the duck and prawns were!
10615,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"This time we also tried the Tom Kha Kai, and it wasn't as memorable, just a limey coconut-y soup, which I now can make equally as good if not better...the Thai tea was great, the SERVICE was outstanding during the meal except we never got the spicy condiments we asked for and then all waitstaff disappeared and we had to ask the owner or manager for the check."
10616,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I'd certainly eat here again if in the area--it's a good value for the money, and tasty :)"
10617,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I know most buffets serve significantly worse food than their a-la-carte items, but this is not one of those buffets."
10618,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I'm a foodie
Love food
This was fun and yummy
Wished I had an empty vat as a stomach so I could have tried everything!"
10619,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Alaskan crab legs were the best I've ever tried, the prime rib was a quality slab of beef, despite the fatty piece I received."
10620,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Everything seemed to just melt in my mouth as it was the perfect balance of flavor.
10621,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"This is an affordable Ramsey restaurant and the food is good, but not memorable....except the dessert milk shakes!"
10622,QUALITY#POSITIVE,This place is super cute and a cozy gem that feels like your in Paris......The bread and butter they bring in the beginning was SO good.
10623,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Don't forget to go to the seafood bar where you can choose seafood and they cook it into a nice stew.
10624,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The sesame provided enough grip despite the juices squeezing out with every bite and were overall structurally sound so my burger remained intact until it was no more.
10625,QUALITY#POSITIVE,creme brulee was really good though.
10626,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Also, my bf has tried Tom Yum soup all over the country (the best being in Boston..) he said this tops it."
10627,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The best item was the siracha sauce.
10628,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Nice place, nice view of the fountain, nice food and friendly staff"
10629,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The sweet potato fries were also good.
10630,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Everything was perfectly cooked and had authentic Thai flavors - i.e.

10637,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food is extremely tasty and has many different flavors involved into it.
10638,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The flavor combinations are amazing.
10639,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"High quality and great variety 
High standards and great value"
10640,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I'd say Mon Ami Gabi's fries comes as 2nd best fries I've ever had (after Michael Symon's Bspot's Lola Fries).
10641,QUALITY#POSITIVE,He answered all our questions about the menu without batting and eyelash and steered me towards one of the best scallop dishes I've ever put in my mouth.
10642,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I pair these up w\/ the shrimp cocktail and damn I'm in heaven

For dinner they take out the congee section and they serve TOM YUM SOUP!!!!"
10643,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The sausages were pretty good too.
10644,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The flavors were unique, fresh and basically tasted like a $15 dollar burger."
10645,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"There are definitely many places to grab a bite at super late\/early hours on the strip, but I give props to EoS for being good quality stuff at a decently low price."
10646,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Aside from the crab legs, there's a ton of other great food---for example:
- mushroom risotto cakes in pea puree
- spaghetti squash au gratin with white truffle oil
- rigatoni in a gorgonzola cream sauce
- poached pear and blue cheese walnut salad
- lychee infused fruit salad
- chipotle rubbed chicken thigh
- rotisserie game hen
- prime rib (of course)
- delicious sushi
- tons of shrimp cocktail
- flatbread pizza
- great dessert: fresh ice cream, sorbet, cupcakes and other desserts

Overall, very very satisfied with the buffet and had a delicious meal."
10647,QUALITY#POSITIVE,As for the food this time around...much better all around.
10648,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"A savory flavor with sweet onions, bread and melted cheese."
10649,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"As Gordon Ramsay would say, ""the burger brings a lot of heat, it's got a nice kick to it!"""
10650,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food was pretty good too and the dessert spread had a good variety of goodies.
10651,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"And although it may seem pricey, for Vegas (and for the quality) it's actually a great deal."
10652,QUALITY#POSITIVE,it was still good anyway.
10653,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The view of the fountains is delightful, the food is good, and the price was not too overpriced given the location."
10654,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The Italian sandwich was great and for $2 extra meat I wasn't upset with the price of it being about $8 or $9.
10655,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Come here for a deliciously decadent dessert in a cute atmosphere!
10656,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The roasted duck curry had a lot of flavor, and the coconut rice with mango for dessert- it's at first very different for a dessert, but as you keep eating it, it gets more comforting and enjoyable."
10657,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Food is good, served with right attitude and ingredients."
10658,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I did enjoy the buffet, found it quite tasty and had a wide range of selection."
10659,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Meatloaf sandwich (the Kokomo) and banana pancakes were beyond awesome (I know, meatloaf and pancakes sounds like the meal of an insane person, but trust me it was great)."
10660,QUALITY#POSITIVE,American sliders and roasted meats were out of this world...I only say that because I recently came back from being vegan for 3 years.
10661,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The bun was soft the burger was cooked perfectly it had a spicy jalapeño and a cool cucumber OMG the sweet potato fries were AMAZING..... well worth my caloric intake.
10662,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Lotus of Siam has no neon lights or Corinthian columns and is unimpressively located in a strip mall, but the food speaks for itself--flawless in technique, exotic in flavor profile, and interpretative in embedding the culinary tradition of the chef's roots."
10663,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Excellent meal.
10664,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food was something to remember along with the experience!
10665,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"One spoonful of this tomato soup and I was in foodie heaven ...

... at 8:30am."
10666,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"It came with 6 pieces of escargots and we used the bread to dip with the remaining of the sauce, delicious!"
10667,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Seafood area is good...the crab legs are a shoo in!
10668,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I tried the Andy's sage fried chicken benedicts, delicious and huge portion."
10669,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Still, the outstanding flavors made up for it and I stopped thinking about it largely after the first bite."
10670,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The selection is still on point.
10671,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I mean yes quality it was good but diversity also, not so much."
10672,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I expected your typical buffet food, but found the quality to be on par with most fine dining establishments."
10673,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I ordered the all American burger and it was amazing when I took my first bite.
10674,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Chicken liver pate - 4\/5 - the liver spread was very flavorful and generous size 
Mussels - 3\/5 - decent sized mussel, strong onion flavors but it still had a strong oceanic taste  
Ribeye- 3\/5 - this thing was huge!!!"
10675,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"the cucumber dressing was really good as well--- 

the chicken and waffles was massivE!"
10676,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I also tried the bf's Caribbean Jerk on my last visit... not something I would have ordered myself, but surprisingly really awesome!"
10677,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I guess if anything stood out, it was the crab legs (I just love crab legs by default) and the desserts."
10678,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Anything I have ordered here has always been really good.
10679,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Use to go to the Wynn Buffet
Now I am going both
I woudn't be able to choose which one is the best
Food is excellent and various
LOVE IT"
10680,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The Mexican cuisine was delicious.
10681,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Both dishes were very good.
10682,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I have been here over a year ago and I thought the food was delicious and presentation was nice.
10683,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"We had a party of 17 for dinner and the servers were fantastic, and food was great."
10684,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The seafood was tasty and fresh on the tower.
10685,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Pork is usually a buffet fail, but these are juicy and perfectly cooked."
10686,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"My date and I ordered the warm brie for an appetizer and though he bit into a large (sexy) piece of garlic on first bite, we both agreed that the flavor was incredible."
10687,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"You can't go wrong with the sundaes and shakes, and the portions are very pleasing."
10688,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The fish is fresh, buttery and crisp, the bun is nicely toasted, the crunchy salted vinegar chips on top add wonderful texture and the tartar sauce is creamy with a nice lemony zing."
10689,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"In fact, this buffet does vegetables with great care, from green beans to pesto whipped potatoes."
10690,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Our server, Victor, was more than entertaining and after noticing how much I loved dessert (and at that point, couldn't quite get up to grab any more), he brought me and my mom some tiramisu and raspberry cheesecake shooters which were the bomb!"
10691,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food is high quality combined with a personal touch from every chief behind the counter.
10692,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The bacon was crunchy (ok slightly overcooked but it was still grrreeaat), fluffy egg, melty cheese, toasty ciabatta."
10693,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I find the food a little pricey for the potion, but the service was good, the ingredients were fresh, and the lighting in the outside patio portion was AMAZING."
10694,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The best thing about WS is definitely the bone marrowwwww!
10695,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I love good corned beef hash, so this place, which was a block away seemed perfect."
10696,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"However, it is an overall solid restaurant on the Vegas strip that will get you good food for a relatively good price with a great view."
10697,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Not only is the cuisine mouth wateringly succulent, the service is second to none."
10698,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Everything here is good, but we want to find the fourth must have dish that goes well with the above three dishes."
10699,QUALITY#POSITIVE,A for the drink and food presentation.
10700,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Okay, I'll give our server her pride in the food that Hash House makes since it was all well presented, very plentiful and quite delicious!"
10701,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The food is phenomenal, the service is excellent!"
10702,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Food was 10\/10 but there was a minor blunder in service.
10703,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Their dessert bar was quite typical for Las Vegas buffets, but I did have a candy apple that was quite good."
10704,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Good flavors and good texture.
10705,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I am a Gordon Ramsay fan from TV and I tried the innocence gone beer, as Britney said it was Ramsay's favorite beer there, it was very good."
10706,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The lobster chowder soup was a bit sweeter than expected but everything else at the seafood station was top notch.
10707,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The meat and seafood choices were the highlights.
10708,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The food is great, a large selection of comfort foods, all taste great."
10709,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I usually order The Earl's Club or The Full Montagu, but I'm going to go ahead and bet that the rest of the sandwiches on their menu are just as good."
10710,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The avocado chipotle chicken sandwich was incredible.
10711,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The French fries were very good as well as the burger.
10712,QUALITY#POSITIVE,It did not suffer the typical buffet issue of the eggs hardening up too much under the heaters.
10713,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Not sure what they do to make that peanut butter sauce, but I wanted to lick the plate and bowl clean!"
10714,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Prime rib, brisket, short rib... they were all sooooo delicious!"
10715,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I went to serendipity a year ago for the first time and the service was great, and the food was on point."
10716,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"There's also stuff I've never heard of, but happily piled onto my plate."
10717,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The lamb was pretty good, nice and pink in the center."
10718,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The Italian station had these flatbread pizzas that looked like nothing special, but tasted delicious, breakfast items and omelette stations (not just one) were also extremely tasty, pulled pork sliders on corn bread muffins are something you rarely see at a buffet, genius."
10719,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Everything was really good and nothing sits boiling on steam trays, which is what turns me off about buffet in general."
10720,QUALITY#POSITIVE,It has less to offer but makes up for it with quality of selection and visual display.
10721,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The Trout Almondine was surprising very good.
10722,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Lastly, the waffle was cooked well, and right in the middle of each piece of waffle was a few slices of bacon, which was an awesome surprise to an already great meal."
10723,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"), chinese, japanese, a little korean, indian, seafood, and the dessert section is heaven!!!!"
10724,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"While a bit on the rich and salty side, I thought it was a dish that rivaled that of many high-end restaurants."
10725,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"But for the quality of the food and their offerings, I think the experience is worth it."
10726,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Yes, it could possibly be the most expensive, but the quality of food and environment of the place is fantastic."
10727,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"It was so good, i finished the whole thing by myself!"
10728,QUALITY#POSITIVE,It was savory and the meat was so tender.
10729,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food is immaculent(word of the day)!
10730,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I enjoyed everything I tried: prime rib, Kung pao chicken, fried chicken, pizza, etc."
10731,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Not disappointed at all after 10 years, everything tasted so good."
10732,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Great food there.
10733,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The only way to describe the carrot relish is by saying that my husband who cannot stand carrots requested for a second serving!!
10734,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Otherwise food is on point.
10735,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Great service, attentive staff and wonderful food."
10736,QUALITY#POSITIVE,They never disappoint and always have the right balance of everything during breakfast.
10737,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The American and BBQ selection was also noteworthy!
10738,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Andy's Benedict is a huuuuge hot mess of fried chicken, spinach, eggs, biscuits, tomatoes, cheese and bacon but it is soooooo good with a lot of different flavors and textures going on."
10739,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Had a great meal.
10740,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Within minutes, I grabbed it and began my wonderful evening of drinking Whiskey, eating an excellent Steak Frites Plate (French style Steak and Fries) and savoring a Banana Foster's Crepe........while daydreaming and checking out the beautiful Bellagio Fountain Show (5 times) and enjoying the cool people watching on the Amazing Strip."
10741,QUALITY#POSITIVE,We expected to eat the best damn burgers but its taste awesome just not as fancy as I thought probably overpriced because it is Gordon's but he didn't make the burgers.. lol...
10742,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food served in the restaurant was a lot better than the experience I had with take out.
10743,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I mean, it's no DTF (in Taiwan), but they made them a lot better than many a Chinese restaurant I've been to, not to mention that they are served individually in adorable miniature steamers and retain their soup very well."
10744,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I don't eat buffet very often, but I do eat food everyday and pretty much everything at this buffet was DELICIOSO!"
10745,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"As it was I was very pleased with the the outer ribeye cap that they had sliced off of one of them for me as it is the best part of the cut imho...
http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=T1MSMPa-rJ4GoKkwTclsWg#M22z-WrpCtwH6p8Ce12LUQ

The dessert section was actually not as big as some buffets but still had a nice sampling of items."
10746,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I tasted the frozen hot chocolate and it was good.
10747,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"From presentation to freshness and quality, every item they served was delicious and the selection is incredible."
10748,QUALITY#POSITIVE,However the BEST thing that I've had from their dessert section is their green tea creme brulee!!
10749,QUALITY#POSITIVE,They make their meals fresh and from scratch so it took another 25 minutes until we got our food.
10750,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"French fries are fabulous, different in shape and texture from any other place I have eaten."
10751,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"But hands down what gives this place a 5 star rating plus my promise to my gluttony to always drop by everytime i'm in Vegas are two things:
The savory, melt-in-your-mouth, filet mignon just lightly teased with butter and crushed peppercorns that is so soft and tender the cow must have lived on milk and honey and slept on a bed of buttered clouds its whole life."
10752,QUALITY#POSITIVE,It was quite tasty but the portion was way too small for $13.95.
10753,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Try this place for the bread alone.
10754,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The ambiance, presentation, and dessert bar still remains the parts I liked best."
10755,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Excellent quality and selection.
10756,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"It totally reminds me of the Disney\/Pixar movie ""Ratatouille"" when Collette is teaching Remy about food: ""How can you tell how good bread is without tasting it?"
10757,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Prices are steep, but they really know how to cook up amazing food."
10758,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"If you like hamburgers, sandwiches, fries, shakes, salads, great breakfast food...and lots of dessert, than this is the place for you!"
10759,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I highly recommend the:

-GARLIC PRAWNS ($21.95)
More of an appetizer, but these whole prawns are fried until crispy and have great garlicky salty flavor."
10760,QUALITY#POSITIVE,It is still  tender and juicy.
10761,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Everyone runs for the crab legs but the highlight of the buffet is the prime rib and the mashed potatoes.
10762,QUALITY#POSITIVE,My mouth is watering just remembering this experience!
10763,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Her specialty is Northern Thai dishes, so be sure to try something you may not be accustomed to if you're used to Bangkok Thai food, like I am."
10764,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"But one good thing was the food,  the food was well made and full of taste..  Alot of other better buffets on the strip."
10765,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The prime rib was the best buffet grade prime rib I've had.
10766,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The Sea Bass (I heard) was tasty.
10767,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"For appetizers we ordered some kind of fried shrimp starter (forgot what it was called), which was really good."
10768,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Never liked that coffee-ish flavor so the tiramisu wasn't for me, but the center was very soft and fluffy."
10769,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Burgers were outstanding and the service was great.
10770,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Try all of the northern dishes!
10771,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Love the truffle fries and the skinny screw is refreshing and tasty.
10772,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I went for my bachelorette party a few years back and that was the first time I'd gone and so happy to have found this place:) Everything is good there, I can't even pick 1 dish..."
10773,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The portion was good I cut the burger in half n couldn't finish it like 1\/3 lb burger.
10774,QUALITY#POSITIVE,No matter what you get you going to be fully satisfied.
10775,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Elizabeth ordered the traditional breakfast and the eggs were cooked perfectly.
10776,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food was impeccable and the drinks were delicious.
10777,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Still, we liked going through the maze that is the Quad to go up the escalator to the yumminess that 
awaited us."
10778,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"While this is at heart a burger joint, it is a high-class one, with exemplary quality control."
10779,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food was delicious.
10780,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I had come here once before with my dad when the Wynn opened and we both preferred the Bellagio buffet then as well, but I at least thought the prime rib here was excellent as well as the King Crab legs."
10781,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Dinner, Could be considered pricy but the food was unique and tasty enough to justify going."
10782,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Excellent service, HUGE portion sizes and all of our food was delicious!"
10783,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"They were everything that everybody has said about them.....huge, delicious, crazy."
10784,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Everything was perfectly spiced and absolutely delicious.
10785,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I didn't care for their gelato 
flavors either."
10786,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I haven't found this sauce anywhere else so I praise its uniqueness.
10787,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The defining part of a sandwich is the bread and Earl's did not disappoint, it was warm, crisp, and fresh deliciousness."
10788,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The food was amazing, but the timing and service of our meal were executed poorly."
10789,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"But if you like spicy food that offer complexity of flavors that go beyond the piquant, the northern larb will not disappoint."
10790,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The dipping sauces were good too, I liked the Honey Mustard best, my husband liked the BBQ sauce."
10791,QUALITY#POSITIVE,French onion soup is a must Best place to people watch if you get the outside seating.
10792,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"For lunch food, there was a pho station, some sushi and rolls, Chinese food like noodles, fried rice and meats, several varieties of pizza and mac and cheese for kids, and super fresh fried chicken (this was really good)."
10793,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Loved the fried pork tenderloin as well, and have enjoyed the chicken fried steak before."
10794,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The frozen hot chocolate was delicious, but the service was kind of slow and not really attentive."
10795,QUALITY#POSITIVE,My bread was perfectly toasted and the sauce on the chicken sandwich was delectable.
10796,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The pasta noodles were cooked to perfection and the boar was juicy and flavorful.
10797,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Fresh ingredients and good chefs resulted in an amazing dining experience.
10798,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Usually buffets have mediocre food  that you stuff yourself silly with, but this buffet had all great and amazing food."
10799,QUALITY#POSITIVE,OMG the food here was amazing!
10800,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"It's definitely not a bad sandwich, especially when it's 2 AM and you're in need of food!"
10801,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I must admit the bean soup was really good though I was hella drunk while eating it.
10802,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"With a name like Hash House, you certainly can't go wrong with their traditional hashes, but the thing to try is the chicken and waffles."
10803,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"It did more than the trick and I literally cried when the bear wouldn't let me eat the leftovers after we got back to the fridge-less hotel & they had been sitting out for a couple hours, I was aching for more of that deliciousness..."
10804,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Pros: Decent burger.
10805,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Everything else was OK, but good for buffet standards."
10806,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Though the prices are a bit on the high end side the food is really that good!
10807,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Got the Full Montagu and after a long night of hitting the clubs, this sandwich definitely hit the spot!"
10808,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The Italian section did have a nice eggplant dish that I'll have to try and make at home; it was soo good.
10809,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The decor, the seating arrangements, the buffet layout, 9 stations of wondrously delicious food.. some individually plated, some AYCE.. give a plate to the crab leg guy , get a plate back of deliciously fresh, hot & steamy legs.. ;) The little sliders were AMAZING.. chicken & waffle portions... chicken wings, hot wings, drumsticks, onion rings, tater tots.. omg."
10810,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"All in all,  I was impressed with the prime rib, the selection overall and the giant crab legs."
10811,QUALITY#POSITIVE,It was authentic to any of khao soi I have had in Chiang Mai and other parts of Thailand.
10812,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Excellent food and great service.
10813,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I think I liked the Caprese best, then next would be the Full Montagu, All-American, and the Italian."
10814,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Satisfied but unwilling to leave Serendipity without sampling one of their signature sundaes the meal was capped with the carrot cake version, a substantial chunk of dense cake complete with cream cheese icing buried in ice cream, walnuts, fudge, and whipped cream that really had no chance of failing in the flavor department if you enjoy sweets, though perhaps a touch less 'subtle' than some like their breakfasts...or lunches...or dinners."
10815,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"When the food came out, I was in love."
10816,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The prime rib was delicious, and so were the crab legs."
10817,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Best presentation and quality for a buffet ever!
10818,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"No, not the best buffet sushi, the absolute BEST sushi."
10819,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I had the Earl's Club (Roasted Turkey, Smoked Bacon, Swiss Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomato & Sandwich Sauce) which was awesome although ""sandwich sauce"" sounded questionable haha."
10820,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food was sub-par and and it was $40.00 per person.
10821,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The French baguettes they serve with your meal was great.
10822,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"In this skillet was a generous serving of delicious, fluffy scrambled eggs that did not taste like they were over milked but were fluffy on their own, some delicious garlicky green beans, some cooked carrot slices, sliced red and orange bell pepper, a metric buttload of roasted potato chunks and four lamb chops."
10823,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Four kinds of ceviche, gourmet salads served in elegant glasses, chicken panang prepared as you like it, a bountiful heaping of preserved meats and cheeses, a generous selection of Indian cuisine, lamb prepared three of four different ways, rare prime rib and juicy plump sausage and tender veal, steamed Chinese pork buns and crispy wontons (no thanks), mounds of crab legs and a variety of smoked fish, pasta made to order (also no thanks)...and those were just the entrees."
10824,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"My boyfriend ordered the corned beef and hash, and it was so good too."
10825,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"No matter what meal you eat, it's going to be delicious."
10826,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The bun was fresh and the burger was a nice size.
10827,QUALITY#POSITIVE,It really hit the spot.
10828,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Although I'm a fan of the fancy cuts of meat and all that, the eggs benedict and their hollandaise sauce were an unexpected highlight to the meal."
10829,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food was awesome...HUGE portions!
10830,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I had several of the sushi items and a hearty salad from the salad bar, and everything was fresh and delicious."
10831,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"the desserts werent as good as the Wynn, but Wicked Spoon wins for concept and variety."
10832,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food is quality and you can taste it.
10833,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The freshly pressed juices are so tasty and a perfect compliment to the food selection.
10834,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"It was a great burger, but the price tag doesn't support what you get (2 burgers, 1 order of onion rings and a drink = 75 bucks)... not this guy!"
10835,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The duck was perfectly cooked and crispy, the curry itself, despite looking heavy, was actually very light on the stomach, and the flavor was just slightly spicy and not overpowering."
10836,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Italian, holiday turkey, and the classic all tasted good."
10837,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Hell's Kitchen burger had a nice kick to it, and I liked it better than the wife's Euro Burger (she loved hers though)."
10838,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Pricey, but that's what comes with the fantastic ambiance and high quality food."
10839,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Tons of different foods, all delicious and some exotic."
10840,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The drunken noodles were nice in that it adds more carbs and makes it more filling.
10841,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Truly an experience not to be missed if you're a foodie, or  if you just love Thai food and you find yourself in Las Vegas."
10842,QUALITY#POSITIVE,All of the different elements and ingredients perfectly harmonized together.
10843,QUALITY#POSITIVE,They also had a taco bar where they freshly cooked carne asada and al pastor.
10844,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The food was delicious, and they had a wide variety of authentic Thai food on their menu."
10845,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Aside from the slightly slow service (30 min to get our burgers), Gordon Ramsay's restaurant makes a pretty mean burger."
10846,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I grabbed plate after plate of seafood and immediately inhaled an entire plate of steamed crab legs.
10847,QUALITY#POSITIVE,creamy texture and delicious flavor.
10848,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"We were confused by the neighborhood and the exterior of the restaurant, but surprised by the quality of the food and service."
10849,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Food taste is also excellent, must try."
10850,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The mains and sides were good, seafood selection meh to poor and OMG the creme brûlée (get it!)."
10851,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food other than the omelet bar was delicious!
10852,QUALITY#POSITIVE,It was just the perfect amount of spicy.
10853,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Best of all, the sides were also solid."
10854,QUALITY#POSITIVE,These are jumbos and not overly salty like some lower quality places.
10855,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food here is basically a high quality version of other vegas buffets.
10856,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The food here is absolutely delicious.
10857,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Great food, decent prices considering it's Vegas and also it's Gordon Ramsay."
10858,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Their salads too, are to die for!"
10859,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Not a large amount of food but plenty and large on flavor.
10860,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The food was good and the portions are huge, but this was nothing amazing, particularly not worth the 90 minutes we had to wait for a table."
10861,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Food was above average for the last vegas buffet I ate at.
10862,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The dishes I chose for my second round weren't as memorable, not for lack of taste and quality, but for my sudden onset of gluttony taking over and turning my memory into a fuzzy haze of delicious food."
10863,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The sush iis fresh, the seafood, the Italian antipasta, the list goes on with high end individual food dishes.Even the deserts where outstanding, usually buffet deserts are tasteless but the pastries here were amazing."
10864,QUALITY#POSITIVE,For the simple fact that the food tasted fresh and not like it was incubating for hours and overall taste!
10865,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Virtually no line at 3pm (start for dinner)  I was very impressed by the pre cut crab legs, the plenty tasteful options to overload and diversify your palette, and just overall experience."
10866,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Their brunch was also very refreshing, most of the morning dishes have eggs and toast in them."
10867,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Where do you get off charging $50 bucks (after taxes) for crap ass buffet that's short on items during the holidays?!
10868,QUALITY#POSITIVE,This restaurant already has a ton of excellent reviews for the food so we will be short.
10869,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"I also recommend the Chilean Sea Bass, the Crab Fried Rice and their Drunken Noodle with whatever [insert meat of preference]."
10870,QUALITY#POSITIVE,One of my favorite buffet must-haves are the oysters.
10871,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Despite the arm and leg you have to offer to be seated at this establishment, I'd have to say the food is to die for."
10872,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I think the variety and quality is tops in the world of AYCE buffet options.
10873,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Steaks are tender, perfectly cooked and the bordelaise is very good."
10874,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The waffles had bacon pieces sandwiched in between them, and tasted delicious with the juicy chicken."
10875,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Your first bite of it will result in an orgasmic burst of traditional Mexican flavors fused with all the protein greatness of well-prepared American meat.
10876,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Not cheap, but you get gourmet all you can eat food!"
10877,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Very good food, well schooled waiters, great view."
10878,QUALITY#POSITIVE,I thought that the profile of the sandwich was very well balanced on flavors.
10879,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Amazing thai food.
10880,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Crunchy and soft in all the right places.
10881,QUALITY#POSITIVE,The combination of all three items was like music in my mouth.
10882,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The rest of my family, being their first time, enjoyed every bite of their meal. '"
10883,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Probably was one of the best short rib dinners I've ever experienced .
