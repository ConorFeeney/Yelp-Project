1185,1185,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"All in all, Hash House was good but a bit over-hyped, over-priced, and probably not worth the wait next time we visit."
1687,1687,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,The outside of the restaurant looks like a hole-in-the-wall type of place located in a shady\/seedy looking strip mall but once you walk inside be prepared for a long wait if you don't already have reservations.

5277,5277,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Amazing view of the fountains, outside patio with mists and a nice breakfast selection."
11260,319,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Food was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience)."

1859,1859,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"love the patio seating, great seats for people watching especially in the blazing heat.... but hey get some mimosas to cool you down.... they had a bloody mary bar which i thought was really amazing...they give u a plain bloody mary and you can add all your garnishes with a variety of olives, celery, all kinds of hot sauce!"

6401,6401,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"For the price of $42, I was expecting most of it to be higher quality."

97,97,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"The food was good, service was great!"
8959,8959,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,It was still a good experience though.
1149,1149,PRICE#NEGATIVE,I would give it 5 stars but the price for food here is RIDIC!
8592,8592,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,But Wicked Spoon in my opinion is very popular because the food keeps a nice level of quality and a few more items that wouldn't normally be seen at a buffet.

1467,1467,PRICE#NEGATIVE,"Despite the arm and leg you have to offer to be seated at this establishment, I'd have to say the food is to die for."
9679,9679,QUALITY#POSITIVE,This is one of those meals and experiences that I'm still thinking about because it was that good.
9785,9785,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"A pricey burger, but a good one nonetheless."
8883,8883,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"ROASTED JALAPEÑO POPPERS - Cheddar bacon, cheddar ranch, one fiery surprise

11114,167,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"We have been to this place many times, and always have great food, wine, and service."
155,155,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Of course, huge line, but I could not believe how fast the line moved and how quickly the food came."

12416,1515,PRICE#NEGATIVE,But $1 for each small piece???

10262,10262,QUALITY#POSITIVE,and lastly the dessert maybe small in scale compare to the Wynn but was scrumptious and different.
8010,8010,FOOD#NEGATIVE,This establishment is less frequented than other establishment which means more food is under the heat lamps longer than usual.
3139,3139,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Overall, I'd give this place 5 stars for friendly service and amazingly large and creative portions, but only 3 stars on taste that doesn't match presentation."

11657,735,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Decor is nice though service can be spotty.
6099,6099,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The service is slow an the food is awful this was my third visit and every time the service and food kept getting worse!

5989,5989,PRICE#POSITIVE,We went in at 2:15pm when they still charge you their lunch price ($38\/person).
4787,4787,FOOD#POSITIVE,Definitely a nice buffet to try a variety of items and get some nice presentation and eye candy from it that you miss out on when you go to a buffet as to a fine dining restaurant in Vegas.
6956,6956,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,They were very slow at moving the line and the staff were not very forthcoming or putting forward good customer service.
5289,5289,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Located on the second floor of Imperial Palace which is a random spot to be, HH is place you should defintely check out if you want some good food and want to avoid buffets."

1539,1539,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"OK they have this non-ironic crap '80s music playing, and these weird little uniforms on the staff, and the FUGLIEST wall decoration: photos of food wrapped up in clothes."
3165,3165,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Yes, it was fun with all the different food booth but my low rating is all about experience."
7103,7103,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"No no no.... That's not how to react to someone spending their time on the phone complaining instead of having fun, act like you care, and try hard to be nice since you are a major asshole."
7962,7962,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"The food offerings here are mostly standard for Vegas buffets: salad bar, crab legs, sushi, dessert bar."

2116,2116,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"If you decide you must eat here sit on the patio, watch the Bellagio fountains ,get a mon ami margarita, and fill up on your frites."

11144,197,QUALITY#POSITIVE,Get the tuna of gari.
11233,292,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Also, because it is so thin, it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling."

11670,749,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,The fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale.

8541,8541,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"In my opinion, the Serendipity 3 in Vegas relies on the draw of their name and offers little more than an average dining experience on the Strip."
1642,1642,LOCATION#NEGATIVE,"Parking in PH sucks though, I have to go through all the shops before getting to the casino."
5610,5610,PRICE#POSITIVE,"The chef ramsay, great job of getting what the fans wanted a burger joint that is affordable."

5432,5432,FOOD#POSITIVE,They also had a huge dessert bar with an excellent selection.

9589,9589,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,"Cool for a buffet, but as a restaurant overall, eh, I'd mildly entertain the thought of returning."

9491,9491,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Don't be turned off by the location-- Lotus of Siam is worth the hype.
7576,7576,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,This time the server ignored us.
1020,1020,PRICE#NEGATIVE,43 per person was worth it for lunch but we got lucky because at 3 dinner started so we got there at 2:30 and got to enjoy both!!!
7253,7253,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,Instead... they were happily giggling and chatting in a corner with a few of the waitstaff.

10853,10853,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Best of all, the sides were also solid."
7430,7430,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"She came back and had put the entire bill on 1 card, what?"
2601,2601,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Overall, this may be a good place to check out if you and the squad are nursing a hangover on a Sunday morning, but I wouldn't go here otherwise."

2729,2729,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"fucked up my breakfast experience.. bad service slow service, others came after us and ate and finished before I got my meal."
460,460,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"I know that we don't go to  buffet and expect good service, but if we already paid 18% gratuity, I expected the service to be 18% worth."

8311,8311,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,i love the Wynn buffet!

11037,88,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Go hungry and enjoy.
5556,5556,PRICE#POSITIVE,"It's your basic in casino restaurant, a cheapish place to grab a bit after you just lost your mortgage payment I guess."
11714,793,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Eating in, the atmosphere saves it, but at your desk, it's a very disappointing experience."
3475,3475,FOOD#POSITIVE,"Bread pudding, I do love my bread pudding, and this place does a kickass job especially for a buffet."
2645,2645,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,This was my favorite buffet and it went downhill from the last time I went.
4361,4361,FOOD#POSITIVE,Left with food coma... hehe
4856,4856,FOOD#POSITIVE,There was a nice variety of items and we loved the plethora of dessert options as well.
5110,5110,FOOD#POSITIVE,"I mean, I've been to Thailand, gone to a Thai cooking class, and eaten every kind of street food there and Lotus of Siam was essentially the same thing minus the plane flight."

9087,9087,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,Other than that we always look forward coming to Bacchanal when we can.
4222,4222,FOOD#POSITIVE,"My friends got the ""Caprese"" sandwich and I got the ""Veggie"" sandwich and they were both SO good."
2245,2245,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The ambiance is still the same, great views of the strip and the people walking by (who needs to pay $75 for a show when you can see a guy dressed like a knock off Woody the Cowboy walk by?)."
2193,2193,LOCATION#POSITIVE,"The atmosphere is great, they do a good job of pulling off the French bistro feel."
7434,7434,SERVICE#NEGATIVE,"Given the price, and the average 30 minutes of wait just for food to arrive, I would NOT recommend this place."
3904,3904,FOOD#POSITIVE,But what made this a 4 star review was the Gelato Bar.
7786,7786,FOOD#NEGATIVE,"Going through the photos others have provided, there were many items I see that were not available when we went."

2133,2133,LOCATION#POSITIVE,Right outside the Paris hotel and next to Miracle Mile.
10794,10794,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"The frozen hot chocolate was delicious, but the service was kind of slow and not really attentive."
1785,1785,LOCATION#POSITIVE,This was a gorgeous restaurant in Paris casino.It had a wonderful patio that was great for people watching and the food was second to none.
9713,9713,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"However, if you want to sample a number of different items, want some quality with your quantitiy, want to stuff yourself on nothing but crab legs and shrimp, desire a fairly nice setting, don't mind the wait, and are stuck on the Strip, then the Wynn buffet is a serious consideration."
9050,9050,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,My wife and I are not big buffet fan but The Buffet at Wynn is really good!

354,354,SERVICE#POSITIVE,"Good food, good service and a lot of fun."
11259,318,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"Food was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience)."
10218,10218,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"- Lives up to its ""gourmet burger"" category but also has some other offerings for people who don't want burgers: lots of choices with really interesting ingredients that can cater to almost any flavor craving."

9223,9223,RESTAURANT#POSITIVE,This is a definite stop for me when I am in Vegas.

I had one of the steak dish, it was cooked medium rare just like how I ordered, but it was a bit heavy on the salt."
6353,6353,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"Use to be the BEST in town
Now the FIRST PLACE is BACCHANAL at caesar palace
I do not recommend anymore the buffet
You would be dIsappointed
We could have thought that after beeing so good they would have make a special effort at the apperance of bacchanal
It is the contruary
Chinese food is not varied and no good
Meat is very poor
Pizzas are awfull
Salads and vegetables with no taste
Deserts are a désolation
Ice cream a joke 
Used to be a huge fan no more !!"

2879,2879,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,"Normally you would think of a buffet as serving sub-par, dried-out food that has been sitting under the heat lamp for hours."

6288,6288,QUALITY#NEGATIVE,"The sponge part (the sticky toffee part) was very authentic, but the ""salted peanut"" ice cream was not good at all - it really didn't taste of anything outside of icy milk."
4000,4000,FOOD#POSITIVE,"There's an area for Asian cuisine, which things such as dim sum & dumplings, an area for American\/Italian food with stuff such as fried chicken and fries in cute little waffle ice cream cones!"
4403,4403,FOOD#POSITIVE,A wide variety of quality food including deserts.
3556,3556,FOOD#POSITIVE,Learned about it thru the Yelp reviews and super glad we were able to check this spot out...Amazingly huge portions that the food lasted us for three days and don't worry about the wait once you get there.
2749,2749,RESTAURANT#NEGATIVE,I am not getting what the rave is about....
9858,9858,QUALITY#POSITIVE,"As soon as I grabbed the warm bag in my hand, I knew I was in for a toasty treat!"
